Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.\n        (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \n        (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n        (d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.\n        (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n        (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n        (g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n        (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. \n        (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n        (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n        (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. \n        (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\n        (n) A, asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n        (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n        (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.\n\n        ",

State of M.P.9 the apex court engaged in an extensive discussion\n        on murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the use of the word\n        \u2018likely\u2019 in section 304. It finally came to the conclusion that conviction under section\n        302 was not warranted. In the words of the court:10\n        All the essential elements show that the appellant did not have any\n        previous quarrel with the deceased; there was lack of animus. The act\n        resulting in SI Tiwari\u2019s death was not premeditated. Though it cannot\n        be said that there was a quarrel, caused by sudden provocation, if one\n        considers that the deceased tried to board the truck, and was perhaps\n        in plain clothes, the instinctive reaction of the appellant was to resist;\n        he disproportionately reacted, which resulted in the deceased being\n        thrown off the vehicle. Such act of throwing off the deceased and\n        driving on without pausing, appears to have been in the heat of passion,\n        or rage. Therefore, it is held that the appellant\u2019s conviction under Section\n        302 IPC was not appropriate.\n        However, in the very next paragraph the conviction is under section 304 part I\n        as the court opined that \u201che had the intention of causing such bodily harm, to the\n        deceased as was likely to result in his death, as it did\u201d.11 It is submitted that if he just\n        wanted to get him off the truck it would well be a case of knowledge and not intention!\n        The initial arguments do not match up with the ultimate conviction.\n        In a case the prosecution was able to establish that the husband poured kerosene\n        over his wife and set her on fire as per her dying declaration. Subsequently, he tried to\n        extinguish the fire and sustained some injuries in the process. The court opined that\n        the case fell squarely under fourthly of section 300 and merely because he might have tried to extinguish the fire did not bring the case out of fourthly of section 300 and\n        convicted the husband on charge of murder under section 302.12\n        A husband was convicted under section 302 IPC for the unnatural death of the\n        wife by the additional sessions judge and the same was upheld by the high court. The\n        courts had relied on section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and the last seen theory.\n        However, as mentioned in Subramaniams v. State of T.N.,13 \u201cOrdinarily when the\n        husband and wife remained within the four walls of a house and death by suicide\n        takes place it will be for the husband to explain the circumstance in which she might\n        have died. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that although the same may be\n        considered to be a strong circumstance but that alone in the absence of any evidence\n        of violence on the deceased cannot be held to be conclusive!\u201d14 The apex court in\n        appeal, taking note of this, held that section 106 Evidence Act and the last seen theory\n        do not absolve the prosecution of discharging its primary duty of proving the\n        prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. The apex court in Shivaji Chintappa Patil\n        v. State of Maharashtra15 set aside the conviction and reiterated that in the case of\n        circumstantial evidence motive needs to be proved and the prosecution failed to do so\n        on all counts.",

This has been the fact situation in many a case and the\n        patriarchal families and the patriarchal state are in no mood to relent. Invariably, the\n        sexual autonomy of the adolescent girl is sought to be negated by the stringent\n        provisions of kidnapping. The words used in the kidnapping provision are, inter alia,\n        \u2018enticing\u2019 and \u2018taking\u2019. The love affair among adolescents is, thus, brought under the\n        ambit of \u2018enticing\u2019, ignoring the fact that it was mutual love, being equal partners in\n        the crime! Yet, the law charges the boy who may be 19-21 years of age \u2013 himself an\n        adolescent (neo adult)21 \u2013 with the severe charges of kidnapping! The facts of Anversinh\n        v. State of Gujarat 22 is a case of a love affair followed by elopement and the father\n        pressing for rape and kidnapping charges. The court was of the view that the contention\n        that it was a consensual affair and the prosecution had joined the accused\u2019s company\n        voluntarily cannot be acceded to, given the unambiguous language of the statute, as she was below 18 years of age.23 It is submitted that this is an age where the state\n        perceives women either as asexual or without any sexual agency! The law has failed\n        its children and the courts are not doing any better. The law leaves no scope for the so\n        called Romeo-Juliet cases and is out to treat consenting partners \u2013 the boy as an\n        accused \u2013 and the girl as the victim. In 2015 in a love affair case in State v. Suman\n        Dass,24 the contention of the Delhi Commission for Women was that there shall be\n        total prohibition upon teenagers and adolescents from having any kind of sexual\n        relationship! To this the learned district judge had responded thus: \u201cI am afraid, if\n        that interpretation is allowed, it would mean that the human body of every individual\n        under 18 years of age is the property of the State and no individual below 18 years of\n        age can be allowed to have the pleasures associated with one\u2019s body\u201d25 It is humbly\n        submitted that this fear has come true in the Aversinh\u2019s case. The girl having owned\n        up the love affair - \u201cThe prosecutrix nevertheless admitted during cross-examination\n        to being in love with the appellant, having had consensual sexual intercourse with\n        him on a prior date and also having met him outside her home on previous occasions\u201d,26\n        was then under the control of the patriarchal family and she changed her stance. In a\n        very problematic way the high court distinguished this case from that of S.\n        Varadarajan27 saying that in that case it was voluntary abandonment:28\n        [T]he High Court has acknowledged that there was a love affair,\n        frequent meetings, and consensual relationship between the parties,\n        which merited the appellant\u2019s acquittal under Section 376 IPC. But in\n        the very same breath, the High Court has also held [Anvarsinh v. State\n        of Gujarat, 2009 SCC OnLine Guj 6145] that the prosecutrix did not\n        willingly leave her parents\u2019 custody and had not consented to be taken\n        for marriage. These two findings were canvassed as being mutually\n        contradictory.\n        The moot question is, did the court come down from its high pedestal to enquire\n        from the girl whether she was enticed or she voluntarily abandoned the care of her\n        guardian? The court in its magnanimity reduced the sentence to the period already\n        undergone, but what about the stigma of criminality which got attached to the boy in\n        a consensual love affair? The court and the Parliament need to seriously introspect.",

State of Haryana29\n        that the phrase \u201csoon before\u201d as appearing in section 304B IPC is not \u201cimmediately\n        before\u201d but it is enough that the prosecution establishes the existence of \u201cproximate\n        and close link\u201d between the dowry death and cruelty!30 The court also raised a concern\n        regarding recording of statements under section 313 Cr PC in a casual manner by the\n        trial courts thereby denying the very purpose of this important provision which enables\n        the accused to offer an explanation for the incriminatory materials appearing against\n        him. The same view was reiterated in another dowry death case in Gurmeet Singh v.\n        State of Punjab.31\n        In a case where the woman went missing from the matrimonial home and there\n        were dowry allegations also and the body was recovered from the banks of the river,\n        a presumption was raised against the husband under section 113B of the Evidence\n        Act. The court in Parvati Devi v. State of Jharkhand32 held that the \u201ccircumstances\n        put together, unerringly point to his guilt in extinguishing the life of a wife within few\n        months of the marriage on her failing to satisfy the demands of dowry\u201d and convicted\n        the husband under sections 304B and 201 IPC.",

The accused preferred an\n        appeal and the Nagpur Bench of the High Court of Bombay disposed off the appeal\n        by acquitting him of section 8 of the POCSO, Act and convicting him for the offence\n        under sections 342 and 354 IPC. The judge while acquitting him of POCSO charge\n        factored in a very controversial issue and observed that \u201cadmittedly it is not the case\n        of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such,\n        there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without\n        penetration\u201d33 This observation caused a national outrage and the Attorney General of\n        India, the National Commission for Women and the State of Maharashtra filed appeals\n        before the apex court and the court through Bela Trivedi J., dealt with the provisions\n        of the POCSO Act threadbare. The court engaged with the objects and reasons for the\n        enactment of the Act and also the Constitution and the Convention of the Right of the\n        Child came to the conclusion that:34\n        The interpretation of Section 7 at the instance of the High Court on the\n        premise of the principle of \u201cejusdem generis\u201d is also thoroughly\n        misconceived. It may be noted that the principle of \u201cejusdem generis\u201d\n        should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute. It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent.\n        .... So far as Section 7 of the POCSO Act is concerned, the first part\n        thereof exhausts a class of act of sexual assault using specific words,\n        and the other part uses the general act beyond the class denoted by the\n        specific words. In other words, whoever, with sexual intent touches\n        the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch\n        the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person,\n        would be committing an offence of \u201csexual assault\u201d. Similarly, whoever\n        does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact\n        without penetration, would also be committing the offence of \u201csexual\n        assault\u201d under Section 7 of the POCSO Act. In view of the discussion\n        made earlier, the prosecution was not required to prove a \u201cskin-toskin\u201d\n        contact for the purpose of proving the charge of sexual assault\n        under Section 7 of the Act.\n        Ravindra Bhat J., gave a concurring judgment deftly engaging with the embedded\n        patriarchal notions in IPC offences like outraging the modesty of a woman. The\n        mandatory minimum was sought to be justified in the judgment given the severity of\n        the crime and the status of a vulnerable child victim. The court held the accused liable\n        for sexual assault under section 7 of the POCSO Act punishable under section 8 of\n        the same and other provisions of the IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment\n        for three years. However, the judges having taken the difficult path of questioning the\n        patriarchy could have also dealt with the problematic aspects of the legislation wherein\n        the consensual cases also fall in the crime category as the definition of child varies\n        from 0-18! And the rigour of the POCSO Act does away with the presumption of\n        innocence giving way to statutory presumption under section 29 of the POCSO Act.\n        The Act mandates that the accused has to discharge this presumption beyond reasonable\n        doubt. And this has to be accomplished factoring in a very important provision\n        contained in section 33(6) of the Act which prohibits aggressive questioning or\n        character assassination of a child. This is indeed necessary so that the victim child is\n        guarded against further victimization. But when looked from the perspective of a\n        framed accused this also becomes a serious issue as he has to put up a spirited defence.\n        And, to top it all, the sentencing discretion has been done away with by incorporating\n        mandatory minimum in the Act. The district judiciary and the special courts will not\n        have the luxury to decide the case in the lines of K. Prakash v. State of Karnataka35\n        wherein the accused were convicted of offences under sections 366 and 344 IPC and\n        section 6 of the POCSO Act and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of\n        10 years. In appeal the apex court magnanimously was of the view that: 36\n        Many factors which may not be relevant to determine the guilt, must\n        be seen with a human approach, at the stage of sentencing. While\n        imposing the sentence, all relevant factors are to be considered, keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of each case. ... The alleged incident\n        is of the year 2014 and we are informed that the appellants have already\n        served sentence of about three months and paid fine amount. They\n        specifically pleaded that there is no one to take care of their minor son\n        and old age parents.",

State of A.P37 is akin to reading a research\n        paper on intersectionality of violence, gender, caste and disability. The judgment by\n        Chandrached J is divided into topics and sub topics (a pattern that the judge has been\n        following) to make it more reader friendly. The judgment unpacks gender, caste and\n        disability and intersectionality very eloquently in a case of rape of a visually challenged\n        girl belonging to the SC community. The court made a very apt observation:38\n        Intersectionality merely urges us to have \u201can open-textured legal\n        approach that would examine underlying structures of inequality\u201d. This\n        requires us to analyse law in its social and economic context allowing\n        us to formulate questions of equality as that of \u201cpower and\n        powerlessness\u201d instead of difference and sameness. The latter being a\n        conceptual limitation of single axis analysis, it may allow certain\n        intersectional claims to fall through the cracks since such claims are\n        not unidirectional in nature.\n        Further, engaging with disability the court remarked:39\n        This kind of a judicial attitude stems from and perpetuates the\n        underlying bias and stereotypes against persons with disabilities. We\n        are of the view that the testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability, or\n        of a disabled witness for that matter, cannot be considered weak or\n        inferior, only because such an individual interacts with the world in a\n        different manner, vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. As long as\n        the testimony of such a witness otherwise meets the criteria for inspiring\n        judicial confidence, it is entitled to full legal weight. It goes without\n        saying that the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive\n        to the fact that the witness\u2019 disability can have the consequence of the\n        testimony being rendered in a different form, relative to that of an\n        able-bodied witness. In the case at hand, for instance, PW2\u2019s blindness\n        meant that she had no visual contact with the world. Her primary mode\n        of identifying those around her, therefore, is by the sound of their voice.\n        And so PW2\u2019s testimony is entitled to equal weight as that of a\n        prosecutrix who would have been able to visually identify the appellant.\n        The court upholding life sentence on charge of rape under section 376 IPC\n        explained that it is difficult and artificial to delineate the many different identities of an individual which overlap to place them in a disadvantaged position of power and\n        create the circumstances for heinous offences such as rape to occur. The court, while\n        factoring in the caste factor, equally engaged with the provisions of the SC/ST Act\n        and after a careful scrutiny allowed the appeal to drop charges under the SC/ST Act.\n        A brilliant judgment by the apex court.40",

And\n        especially where marriages are concerned the communities remain totally embedded\n        in issues of caste. In a case46 a boy and a girl belonging to different caste wanted to\n        marry. A panchayat was convened and the girl from the Jat community made her\n        intention clear of marrying her lover who belonged to the Jatav community. This\n        infuriated the Jat community and they ordered that the boy and another boy who\n        accompanied the couple be hung upside down and their private parts be burned. This\n        was not the end of the macabre show. These two boys along with the girl were ordered\n        to be hanged to death and they were taken to a \u2018Banyan Tree\u2019, and the parents of the\n        three youngsters were forced to pull the rope to strangulate them! 35 people were\n        convicted by the trial court and in appeal the high court acquitted two persons. It also\n        commuted the death penalty of eight persons to life imprisonment. The convicts\n        appealed before the apex court against the conviction under section 302/149 IPC. \n        The apex court in appeal, while upholding the high court judgment (while\n        acquitting two due to doubtful identities), summarized the scope of section 149 IPC\n        in the following words:47\n        Section 149 of the Penal Code, 1860 is declaratory of the vicarious\n        liability of the members of an unlawful assembly for acts done in\n        prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for such offences\n        as the members of the unlawful assembly knew would be committed\n        in prosecution of that object.

It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove each of the\n        members\u2019 involvement especially regarding which or what act (Masalti\n        supra). While overt act and active participation may indicate common\n        intention of the person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the\n        unlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminal liability under\n        Section 149.",

The section declares that members of an unlawful assembly can be held vicariously liable for offences committed in furtherance of the assembly's common object. If an unlawful assembly is formed with the common object of committing a crime, all members are vicariously liable for any offence committed in pursuit of that object, even if not all members directly committed the act. Additionally, if an offence is committed by one member and other members knew that such an offence was likely to be committed, they are also liable.

In\n        this case a child was reprimanded by a teacher for repeatedly bunking classes and his\n        parents were called. The child committed suicide that night and was found hanging at\n        4 a.m. The physical training instructor was charged and convicted by the high court\n        for abetment of suicide. The apex court setting aside the judgment of the high court in\n        Geo Varghese v. State of Rajasthan49 observed thus:50 Insofar as, the suicide note is concerned, despite our minute examination\n        of the same, all we can say is that suicide note is rhetoric document,\n        penned down by an immature mind. A reading of the same also suggests\n        the hyper-sensitive temperament of the deceased which led him to take\n        such an extraordinary step, as the alleged reprimand by the accused,\n        who was his teacher, otherwise would not ordinarily induce a similarly\n        circumstanced student to commit suicide.\n        Section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 raises a presumption of suicide\n        being abetted by husband or such relative if the essential ingredients or the offence\n        are stand satisfied. In a case where the woman committed suicide within two years of\n        marriage and the offence of cruelty stood proved the court presumed that it was a case\n        of abetment. The presumption can be rebutted and since no material was brought on\n        record to disprove this presumption the high court conviction under sections 498A\n        and 306 IPC was upheld in Gurmansinh v. State of Gujarat.51\n        Mere harassment without any positive action on the part of the accused proximate\n        to the time of the occurrence of the suicide would not amount to an offence under\n        section 306 IPC.52\n        The court reiterated in Bhagwanrao Mahadeo Patil v. Appa Ramchandra\n        Savkar53 that section 306 IPC is broader in its application and one aspect of it is\n        section 304B.

Compensation of Rs. three\n        lakhs was deposited and since the widow of the victim did not appear despite notice\n        being served, a lenient view was taken regarding sentencing 55\n        The court in Murali v State56 factored in the amicable settlement while sentencing\n        and opined that since sections 324 and 307 IPC are not in the list of compoundable\n        offences, nevertheless the courts can exercise discretion by factoring in the compromise\n        and reducing the quantum of sentence. Similarly, in Sy Azhar Sy Kalander v State of\n        Maharashtra57 the court taking into consideration, inter alia, the compromise entered\n        into between the two parties while upholding the conviction under section 307 IPC\n        reduced the quantum of punishment to five years. However, in Bhagwan Narayan\n        Gaikwad v State of Maharashtra58 the court was non-plussed by a compromise in a conviction under section 326 IPC. The fact that 28 years had elapsed and the families\n        were now on cordial terms did not move the court to give any benefit of the alleged\n        compromise! The victim was leading his life with a prosthetic arm and leg as a result\n        of the assault which made him permanently disabled.\n        There has been a trend that in some of the cases the courts factor in the possibility\n        of future crimes while deciding the quantum of sentence.

State of U.P59 gave seven years imprisonment (as one it was a pre\n        2018 case so minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years was not attracted) The discretion\n        was to give the sentence ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. The court\n        observed \u201ctaking into consideration all facts including that no material is available on\n        record to indicate that the appellant has any criminal antecedents and that he is also a\n        father of five children \u2026.., it appears that there is no reason to apprehend that the\n        appellant would indulge in similar acts in future\u201d? 60.\n        If consensual sex was the consideration, the court did not mention that. Since\n        the girl was minor, it was a case of statutory rape. Therefore, the reasoning of the\n        court begs a question that why then in certain cases stricter punishments are awarded\n        keeping the deterrence theory in mind \u2013 that it will deter others? It would be very\n        humane if the judges were to examine this aspect in each case whether the accused\n        has a proclivity for further crimes.\n        In a case where the right of private defense was exceeded the court took note of\n        the fact that the complainants\u2019 family members were the aggressors and they had tried\n        to disturb the peaceful possession of the accused from the land.

It covers cases where courts have taken into account factors such as amicable settlements, the possibility of future crimes, and the circumstances surrounding the offenses when determining the quantum of punishment. In **Murali v. State**, the court showed leniency in sentencing due to an amicable settlement and the absence of the victim's widow in court despite notice. Similarly, in **Sy Azhar Sy Kalander v. State of Maharashtra**, the court reduced the sentence for an offense under **Section 307 IPC** based on a compromise between the parties. However, in **Bhagwan Narayan Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra**, the court did not consider a compromise in sentencing due to the severity of the victim's injuries, which resulted in permanent disability. The document also addresses cases where courts factor in the potential for future crimes when determining sentences. In **Manoj Mishra v. State of U.P.**, the court awarded seven years of imprisonment, considering the absence of prior criminal antecedents and the appellant's familial responsibilities. The case raised questions about the application of stricter punishments and deterrence theories. Additionally, it discusses cases where the right of private defense was exceeded, leading to reduced sentences and fines. For instance, in a case involving an offense under **Section 304 Part II**, the court considered the context of the conflict and imposed a reduced sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment with a fine.",

State of Jharkhand 62 wherein it\n        got listed to be heard in the open court since death penalty was awarded to the\n        petitioners by the trial court which was upheld by the high court. The court made it\n        clear that the only jurisdiction in a review petition is to see if there has been a patent\n        mistake or glaring omission due to judicial fallibility. The court did not find any such\n        reason to interfere in the instant case. However, the court took note of the fact that\n        there is a possibility of reformation and rehabilitation. The conduct of the petitioners\n        during incarceration was satisfactory and this moved the court to commute death\n        penalty to sentence of a period of 30 years.\n        Young offenders are to be given a different treatment so that the society is able\n        to reclaim and rehabilitate them. Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 is one such\n        enactment which is precisely to meet these ends. However, it remains one of the most\n        underutilized legislation in the country. It was heartening to note that the apex court given the young age of the accused being 19 and 21 at the time of commission of\n        crime, utilized the provisions of this progressive Act in Lakhvir Singh v. State of\n        Punjab63 and held that \u201cthis is a fit case that the benefit of probation can be extended\n        to the appellants under the said Act in view of the provisions of section 4 of the said\n        Act on completion of half the sentence\u201d64. However, the reasoning of the court was\n        problematic inasmuch as it based its decision of invoking the Probation of Offenders\n        Act,1958 on a reasoning that the victim had forgiven them (that also possibly with\n        passage of time). The beneficial provision cannot be left to the temperament of the\n        victim \u2013 whether he/she is vindictive or retributive or forgiving but has to be based on\n        the nature of the crime and the character of the offender.,",

State of Jharkhand**, the apex court reviewed a death penalty case and emphasized that the scope of a review petition is limited to identifying patent mistakes or glaring omissions due to judicial fallibility. Despite not finding any such errors, the court noted the potential for reformation and rehabilitation of the petitioners and commuted the death penalty to a 30-year sentence based on their satisfactory conduct during incarceration. The document also explores the underutilization of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958, which aims to provide different treatment for young offenders to facilitate their reformation. In **Lakhvir Singh v. State of Punjab**, the Supreme Court applied the provisions of this Act to young offenders aged 19 and 21 at the time of the crime, granting them probation after serving half their sentence. However, the decision to extend probation was controversially based on the victim's forgiveness rather than solely on the nature of the crime and the offender's character.",

Similarly, in **Bhagchandra v.

State70 wherein the court iterated\n        thus:\n        It is well settled law that TIP is not a substantive piece of evidence and\n        may only be relied upon when the substantial evidence is\n        uncorroborated. Identification tests are primarily meant for the purpose\n        of helping the investigating agency with an assurance that their progress\n        with the investigation into the offence is proceeding on the right lines.\n        The case of Jaikam Khan v. State of U.P.71 showcases how even in cases where\n        death penalty is awarded and the same is being confirmed by the high court the attitude\n        of the trial courts is often found wanting. The case reminds one of the infamous\n        Shinde case. But no lessons have been learnt. The Supreme Court was completely\n        shocked by the apathy of the trial court and remarked \u201cIt is really surprising, as to\n        how the Additional Sessions Judge could have dealt with the present case in such a\n        casual manner when he was considering the question of life and death of four\n        accused\u201d.72 The high court, being the superior court, with more experience, maturity\n        and wisdom was equally apathetic as is reflected in the apex court\u2019s observation:73\n        We are amazed by the manner in which the High court has dealt with\n        the present matter. It will be apposite to refer to the following\n        observations of the High Court with regard to the recovery of clothes.\n        \u201cIt has been urged that in order to prove the recovery of the clothes, no\n        independent witness was produced. It is correct that the prosecution\n        only produced the formal witness to prove the recovery, but on the\n        other hand the disclosure of this fact about the room having been opened\n        by the keys provided by Hina, the daughter of accused Momin was not\n        rebutted by the defence which could have been done by producing\n        Hina in order to deny any such recovery.\n        These judgments are a telling commentary on the quality of training that is\n        imparted in judicial academies. The law on paper is as good as the human mind\n        interpreting it. And so it is essential that periodic training programmes are conducted\n        for the judges.",

State of U.P.**: This case demonstrated significant judicial shortcomings. The Supreme Court was shocked by the trial court\u2019s casual approach to a case involving the death penalty. The apex court criticized both the trial and high courts for their inadequate handling of the case, particularly concerning the recovery of evidence without independent witnesses and the general lack of diligence. The court\u2019s observations highlighted the need for better judicial training, noting that the quality of legal proceedings is often a reflection of the training judges receive.
