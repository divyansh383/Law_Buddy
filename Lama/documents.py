        ###Key notes for IPC section 375 ###
        1) Rape.—Offence of rape is against entire society. It is extremely reprehensible and hated crime which defiles and degrades victim physically as well as mentally and shakes very core of life and dignity, Anurag Soni v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2019) 13 SCC 1.
        2) Intention/Consent/Mens Rea.—“Consent” is stated to be an act of reason coupled with deliberation. It denotes an active will in the mind of a person to permit the doing of an act complained of. Inference as to consent can be drawn on the basis of evidence or probabilities of the case, with regard to relevant circumstances, Kaini Rajan v. State of Kerala, (2013) 9 SCC 113 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 858. 
        3) Underage victim.—Where age of victim was about 14 years at the time of offence, question of consent was of no consequence, State of H.P. v. Shree Kant Shekari, (2004) 8 SCC 153. 
        4) Consensual sexual relationship.—Court must ascertain whether both parties were ad idem on essential features, Vinod Kumar v. State of Kerala, (2014) 5 SCC 678 : (2014) 2 SCC (Cri) 663. 
        5) Consent of prosecutrix to physical relationship.—Consent given under misconception of fact is no consent in eyes of law but, misconception of fact, has to be in proximity of time to occurrence, Maheshwar Tigga v. State of Jharkhand, (2020) 10 SCC 108.

        ###Explanation for IPC section 375 ###
        Explanation 1.—For the purposes of this section, “vagina” shall also include labia majora. 
        Explanation 2.—Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman by words, gestures or any form of verbal or nonverbal communication, communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act: Provided that a woman who does not physically resist to the act of penetration shall not by the reason only of that fact, be regarded as consenting to the sexual activity.

        Sex with minor wife.—Sexual intercourse with minor (below 18 years) wife is rape. 
        Exception 2 to Section 375 IPC is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical and violative of Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. However, the verdict will apply prospectively, Independent Thought v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 800. Section 198(6) of the CrPC will apply to cases of rape of “wives” below 18 years, and cognizance can be taken only in accordance with the provisions of Section 198(6) of the Code, Independent Thought v. Union of India, (2017) 10 SCC 800.

        ###keypoint of IPC section 375 ### 
        ► Meaning of “consent” with respect to Section 375.—“Consent” with respect to Section 375 involves an active understanding of circumstances, actions and consequences of proposed act. Individual who makes a reasoned choice to act after evaluating various alternative actions (or inaction) as well as various possible consequences flowing from such action or inaction, consents to such action, Pramod Suryabhan Pawar v. State Of Maharashtra, (2019) 9 SCC 608. 
        ► Consent under misconception of fact.—While Section 90 of Penal Code does not define term “consent”, “consent” based on a “misconception of fact” is not consent in the eye of law. Thus, in case of woman engaging in sexual relations on false promise to marriage, her “consent” is based on “misconception of fact”, and such sexual act(s) will amount to rape, Pramod Suryabhan Pawar v. State Of Maharashtra, (2019) 9 SCC 608, See also Anurag Soni v. State of Chhattisgarh, (2019) 13 SCC 1.

        ###Key Points for IPC section 376 ###
        ► Rape of young girl children.—When statutory provisions regarding rape of minor girls and punishment therefor exists under Section 376(2)(i) IPC, Court can neither enhance punishment so provided nor can it create a new offence and prescribed punishment in that regard. This is a legislative function and Court can only make suggestions to legislature, Supreme Court Women Lawyers Assn. (SCWLA) v. Union of India, (2016) 3 SCC 680.
        ► Rape or gang rape — Determination.—A case is not of gang rape, when the evidence does not indicate that the other accused committed rape on the prosecutrix, nor that they shared the common intention to rape nor aided the commission of rape by the person who did commit rape, Manoj Mishra v. State of U.P., (2021) 10 SCC 763.
        ► Statement of prosecutrix — Corroboration when required.—Testimony of the victim in rape cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable, Sham Singh v. State of Haryana, (2018) 18 SCC 34.
        ► DNA test.—Traditional “autosomal-STR” DNA analysis vis-à-vis “Y-STR” method of DNA analysis, distinguished. In cases of sexual assault DNA of victim and the perpetrator are often mixed, and, “Y-STR” method provides a unique way of isolating only the male DNA, hence, “Y-STR” method of DNA analysis preferably be followed, Ravi v. State Of Maharashtra, (2019) 9 SCC 622.
        ► Promiscuity/Habituation to sexual intercourse of prosecutrix.— Promiscuity/habituation to sexual intercourse of prosecutrix cannot be a ground to justify rape, State (NCT of Delhi) v. Pankaj Chaudhary, (2019) 11 SCC 575.

Provisions of 2013 Amendment Act cannot be given retrospective effect as that would violate Article 20(1), Shatrughna Baban Meshram v. State of Maharashtra, (2021) 1 SCC 596.

        Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. 
        Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it.
        Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.
        Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.

        (a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.
        (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. 
        (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.
        (d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.
        (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. 
        (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.
        (g) A finds a ring lying on the high road, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property. 
        (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft. 
        (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.
        (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.
        (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft. 
        (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.
        (n) A, asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. 
        (o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.
        (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.
