It delves into crucial areas such as online privacy , data protection, cybercrimes,\\nand electronic evidence, providing valuable insights into the development of cyber\\nlaw in India. This survey serves as a practical guide for navigating the intricate\\nchallenges of the digital realm. Additionally , it presents a critical perspective on the\\ncourt’ s reasoning, identifying points that may be subject to further debate. Overall,\\nthe survey underscores the dynamic nature of cyber law and its significant impact on\\nthe legal framework, reflecting the judiciary’ s efforts to adapt to the challenges posed\\nby the digital age.\\nII ADMISSIBILITY  OF ELECTRONIC EVIDENCE: SECTION 65B IEA\\nThe introduction of sections 65A  and 65B in the Evidence Act in 2000 provided\\na framework for the admissibility of electronic evidence, with section 65B (1) allowing\\nfor the admissibility of a paper printout of information contained in electronic records\\nsubject to the conditions specified in section 65B(2).\\nHowever , the requirement for a certificate under section 65B of the Indian\\nEvidence Act for electronic records to be admissible in court has been a matter of\\ndebate among legal scholars and courts. While the Supreme Court in Anvar P .V. v.\\nP.K. Basheer1 (Anvar  hereinafter) held that such records cannot be admitted as\\nsecondary evidence unless the requirements of section 65B are met, the court in Shafhi\\nMohammad 2 (Shafhi  hereinafter) concluded that the certificate requirement may be\\nwaived wherever the interest of justice so justifies say when the electronic device\\nstoring the records is inaccessible or  where the electronic device is produced by a\\nparty who is not in possession of such device, as a result of which such party would\\nnot be in a position to secure the requisite certificate.\\n* Assistant Professor , The Indian Law Institute, New Delhi.\\n1 (2014) 10 SCC 473.\\n2 (2018) 2 SCC 801 (decided on Apr. 25, 2018).', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\010-Cyber Law.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Cyber Law Vol. LVII] 193\\nIn a recent decision, Arjun Panditrao Khotkar  v. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal3\\n(Arjun Panditrao Khotkar hereinafter), a three-judge bench4 of the Supreme Court\\nclarified that the certificate required under section 65B(4) is a prerequisite for the\\nadmissibility of electronic evidence. The bench af firmed the correctness of the Anvar\\nruling in its interpretation, while finding that the Shafhi decision’ s division bench\\nhad erroneously “clarified” the requirement. The court also noted that the certificate\\nis not necessary if the original electronic record is produced in court, however ,\\ncompliance with section 65B is compulsory before a ‘computer output’, which is\\nconsidered secondary evidence of an electronic record, can be admitted as evidence.\\nThe court stated that if a person refuses to provide the certificate required under\\nsection 65B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act, a party can make an application to the\\njudge requesting the production of the certificate. The court also explained that if it is\\nimpossible for the person to provide the certificate, or if the law excuses the person\\nfrom doing so, then the party should be excused from the mandatory requirement of\\nsection 65B (4).5 The court instructed trial courts to summon the person(s) specified\\nin section 65B (4) when a defective certificate is given or when a certificate is refused,\\nand require them to provide the necessary certificate. The court clarified that since\\nsection 65(B) does not talk about the stage at which such certification can take place,\\nthis is subject to the discretion exercised by the courts in civil cases, and in criminal\\ntrials, the accused must be supplied with all documents that the prosecution seeks to\\nrely upon before the trial. The courts must balance the rights of the parties while\\nexamining any application by the prosecution under sections 91 or 31 1 of the Criminal\\nProcedure Code, 1973 or section 165 of the Evidence Act, ensuring no serious or\\nirreversible prejudice to the accused.\\nAlthough the relaxation of the strict requirements under section 65B (4) was\\naimed at easing the burden on parties who have made best ef forts to obtain a certificate\\nbut failed to do so, it has been ar gued that such an exception goes beyond what the\\nstatute permits and creates further ambiguity . Furthermore, the obligation on the courts\\nto summon the authorized person(s) to produce the certificate could result in a\\nprolonged mini-trial within the trial, adding to the already overburdened judicial system\\nand causing delays and additional expenses for the parties involved.\\nAfter the Arjun Panditrao Khotkar6 case, various high courts in India have\\nfollowed its ratio in their respective judgments especially on the exception created.\\nThey have held that electronic evidence must be accompanied by a certificate under\\nsection 65B of the Indian Evidence Act to be admissible in court. Failure to comply\\nwith this requirement results in the electronic evidence being inadmissible.\\n3 2020 SCC OnLine SC 571(decided on July14, 2020).\\n4 Bench consisting of RF Nariman, S. Ravindra Bhat, and V. Ramasubramanian\\n5 Due to the applicability of the Latin maxims ‘lex non cogit ad impossibilia’  (the law does not\\ndemand the impossible) and ‘impotentia excusat legem’  (when there is a disability that makes\\nit impossible to obey the law , the alleged disobedience of the law is excused).\\n6 Supra note 3; 2020 SCC OnLine SC 571(decided on July14, 2020).', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\010-Cyber Law.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Annual Survey of Indian Law 194 [2021\\nIn Rakesh Kumar Singla  v. Union of India7  the petitioner , under the NDPS Act,\\nfiled a bail petition claiming they were unlawfully detained as no contraband was\\nfound in their possession at the time of arrest. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)\\npresented statements from a co-accused and the petitioner as evidence. However , the\\ncourt emphasized that the determination of the petitioner ’s guilt or innocence should\\nbe based on the evidence presented during the trial. The NCB opposed the bail\\napplication, citing WhatsApp chat screenshots as evidence connecting the petitioner\\nto the illicit drugs. Nevertheless, the court stated that WhatsApp messages cannot be\\nconsidered as valid evidence without a certificate under section 65B of the Indian\\nEvidence Act, as per the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case of Arjun Panditrao\\nKhotkar  v. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal.8 Therefore, the court concluded that the\\nWhatsApp messages, in their current state, hold no evidentiary value. Investigating\\nagencies may rely on WhatsApp messages during a crime investigation, but a certificate\\nunder section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act is necessary for their admissibility .\\n In Mahendra N. Par deshi v. State of Maharashtra9 the prosecution attempted\\nto prove the content of a DVR as evidence in a bribery case under section 7 and\\n13(1)(d) read with 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, but failed to produce\\nthe original DVR or a certificate under section 65-B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act.\\nThe court held that verbal evidence about the contents of an electronic record is\\nconsidered secondary evidence and the prosecution must prove that the contents of\\nthe DVR were heard. The court found that the prosecution failed to provide evidence\\nthat the contents of the DVR were heard and the witness could not confirm the\\nconversation’ s content. Additionally , since the record was deleted, the court drew an\\nadverse inference against the prosecution and dismissed the case.\\nIn Yogesh Arun W akure v. State of Maharashtra ,10 the appellant, an accused\\nfacing the char ge of murder punishable under section 302, 201, 323, 143, 147, 149\\nread with section 135 of the IPC with others, tried to establish his presence inside the\\nhotel on the basis of the CCTV  footage. However , an eye-witness claimed to have\\nseen the present appellant at the crime spot around the time of murder .\\nIt was contended from the appellant side that the trial court should not have\\ndisregarded the IO’ s report based on call detail records (CDR) and subscriber detail\\nrecords (SDR) without considering section 65B and relied solely on the word of mouth\\nof the eye-witness  as it is often said that “humans may lie, but documents would not\\nlie” or “documents would speak louder than words”. The apex court has held in Anvar11\\nthat electronic records must be produced according to section 65B, after which their\\ngenuineness can be questioned and resort can be made to section 45A of the Evidence\\nAct for seeking an opinion of the examiner of electronic evidence. The court directed\\nthe Registrar to transmit the documents, including the CDR/SDR record and DVD, to\\n7 MANU/PH/001 1/2021.\\n8 Supra note 3.\\n9 2020 SCC OnLine Bom 7873(Decided on Oct. 23,2020).\\n10 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 354 (Decided on Mar . 10, 2021).\\n11 Supra note 1.', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\010-Cyber Law.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The trial court will open the envelope upon receipt,\\nand the contents will be a part of the original record.\\nIn the case of Pramod v. State of Maharashtra,12 the accused faced char ges\\nunder various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 including murder , kidnapping,\\nand destruction of evidence. The prosecution sought to rely on electronic evidence in\\nthe form of Call Data Records (CDR) to prove their case.\\nThe defense counsel ar gued that the electronic evidence presented by the\\nprosecution is not admissible because the certificates do not comply with section 65B\\n(4) of the Evidence Act. The certificates do not identify the electronic record containing\\nthe statements and do not specify the devices or computers over which they had control.\\nThe defense counsel also pointed out that none of the certificates are signed by a\\nperson occupying a responsible of ficial position in relation to the operation of the\\nrelevant device or the management of the relevant activities. Therefore, the certificates\\nrelied upon by the prosecution in support of electronic evidence are not admissible in\\nevidence. The defense counsel did not dispute the exchange of calls between the\\naccused persons or the findings of the trial court regarding the cell phone locations of\\nthe accused persons and exchange of calls between them at the relevant time.\\nSections 65A  and 65B of the Evidence Act, deal with the admissibility and\\ncontents of electronic records as evidence in court. Electronic records are considered\\nto be complete in themselves and can be admissible as evidence subject to the\\nprovisions of Section 65B (4) of the Evidence Act. Section 65B(1) of the Evidence\\nAct distinguishes between the original electronic record and the output from such\\ndevices, which is a copy or data derived from the original document. The original\\nelectronic record is the one on which the information is first stored, and the secondary\\ndocument is the one that contains the information derived from the original electronic\\nrecord. The same was expounded by the Supreme Court in the case of Arjun Panditrao\\nKhotkar  in the following words:13\\n73.2. The clarification referred to above is that the required certificate\\nunder Section 65B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is\\nproduced. This can be done by the owner of a laptop computer , computer\\ntablet or even a mobile phone, by stepping into the witness box and\\nproving that the concerned device, on which the original information\\nis first stored, is owned and/or operated by him. In cases where the\\n“computer” happens to be a part of a “computer system” or “computer\\nnetwork” and it becomes impossible to physically bring such system\\nor network to the Court, then the only means of providing information\\ncontained in such electronic record can be in accordance with Section\\n65B(1), together with the requisite certificate under Section 65B(4).\\nThe last sentence in Anvar P .V. (supra)  which reads as “…if an\\nelectronic record as such is used as primary evidence under Section 62\\nof the Evidence Act…” is thus clarified; it is to be read without the\\n12 2021 SCC OnLine Bom 3344\\n13 Arjun Panditrao Khotkar   supra note 3 in para no. 73.', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\010-Cyber Law.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Annual Survey of Indian Law 196 [2021\\nwords “under Section 62 of the Evidence Act,…” With this clarification,\\nthe law stated in paragraph 24 of Anvar P .V. (supra)  does not need to\\nbe revisited.\\nSections 65A  and 65B of the Evidence Act deal with the admissibility and\\ncontents of electronic evidence. A section 65B(4) certificate is mandatory for secondary\\nevidence and can be given by a person in a responsible position related to device\\noperation or management. The court relied on previous rulings Arjun Panditrao\\nKhotkar  14 and Engineering Analysis Centr e15 to hold that the prosecution should be\\nrelieved of the obligation to provide a section 65B(4) certificate if they have made\\nefforts to obtain it but have no control over the relevant third-party companies. The\\ncourt found that the electronic evidence produced by the prosecution was admissible\\nin and suf ficiently corroborated the circumstantial evidence presented. The certificates\\nproduced by the prosecution were found to identify the electronic records and describe\\nthe manner in which they were produced as mandated by apex court in Anvar . The\\ncourt noted that section 65B(4) is mandatory but any infirmity in the certificates can\\nbe overlooked given the circumstances.\\n The prosecution in State of Maharashtra, thr ough the Police S tation Officer v.\\nSagar V ishwanath Borkar16 case relied on CCTV  footage, which was copied onto a\\npen drive and a certificate under section 65B of the Evidence Act was taken. However ,\\nthe prosecution failed to produce primary evidence in the form of the hard disc of the\\nCCTV  footage. The court held that the prosecution needed to comply with sub-section\\n(4) of section 65B of the Evidence Act, which requires evidence of a person in a\\nresponsible of ficial position in relation to the operation or management of the CCTV\\nsystem. The mere exhibition of the CCTV  footage by the trial court and the absence\\nof objections by the accused are not suf ficient to make the footage admissible. The\\ncourt cited Arjun Panditrao Khotkar  17to support this ruling. As a result, the CCTV\\nfootage cannot be relied upon as admissible evidence by the prosecution as it was not\\nsupported by a certificate under section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act. The court opined\\nthat the trial court was correct in refusing to rely on this evidence for non-compliance\\nwith section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act.\\nIn Sanjib Sarkar v. Rajasr ee Roy ,18 a matrimonial dispute concerning the\\nannulment of marriage under section 25(III) of the Special Marriage Act, the\\nadmissibility of electronic evidence, including Facebook posts and pictures, submitted\\nby the respondent/wife was challenged by the appellant/husband’ s counsel on the\\ngrounds of lack of certification under section 65B (4) of the Indian Evidence Act.

The court held that the required certification\\nwas not necessary for original documents produced by the owner of the device who\\ncan prove ownership and operation by stepping into the witness box. However , in\\nsituations where the source of information is part of a computer or computer network,\\ncertification under section 65B(4) is required. In the present case, the electronic\\nevidence relied upon by the respondent was sourced from her original electronic device\\nand therefore, certification was not required. The court found that the evidence\\npresented by the respondent was admissible and she had proved her contention relating\\nto fraud practiced on her .\\nIn another case of Sachin Makade Bablu Bhagwan Dangr e v. Nar cotics Contr ol\\nBureau,20 the accused individuals were char ged with dealing in illegal medical drugs,\\nit was ar gued by accused that no such drugs were found in their possession or at their\\nplaces of residence or work. The sole evidence against them was supposedly retrieved\\nfrom their electronic devices, which have been contested as inadmissible without a\\ncertificate under section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act. The defense ar gued that the\\npossibility of future criminal behavior must be taken into account under section 37\\nNDPS, and that the recovered Tramadol tablets from Dipu Singh cannot be linked to\\nthe accused individuals. Additionally , the information extracted from their electronic\\ndevices cannot be accepted without the requisite certificate under section 65B of the\\nIndian Evidence Act.\\nThe court, citing the cases of Arjun Panditrao Khotkar  21 and Engineering\\nAnalysis Centr e of Excellence Private Limited v. The Commissioner of Income T ax,22\\nstated that the mandatory obligation under section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act\\nmay be waived if the respondent has made all reasonable attempts to obtain the\\nnecessary certificate, even if it was to be provided by a third party who was not under\\ntheir control.\\nAlthough the National Control Bureau (NCB) obtained section 65B certificates\\nfrom a cyber forensic expert who analyzed the electronic devices and extracted the\\ndata, the court concluded that it was not suf ficient grounds to grant the accused\\nindividuals bail at this time. The court dismissed both petitions, but granted them the\\nfreedom to reapply for bail after examining public witnesses regarding the recovery .\\nAll pending applications were also resolved.\\nIn an interesting application filed by the petitioner under article 227, Sitanshi v.\\nVandana Sharma,23 seeking directions for Bharti Airtel Limited to preserve and produce\\nthe CDR of the respondent’ s mobile number .

The use of sexually\\ncolored remarks does not amount to the publication or transmission of sexually explicit\\nmaterial. The term “sexually explicit” has a specific meaning and does not include\\nnews or informational material.

However ,\\nthe court expressed concerns about the evidentiary value of the FSL report, as it was\\nunclear whether it constituted substantive evidence or merely corroborative evidence.\\nThe court emphasized that the testimony of the individual who witnessed the incident\\nor the victim herself would be crucial as substantive evidence, while the recorded\\nmaterial stored on the memory card could serve as corroborative evidence.\\nWhile acknowledging the presence of pornographic images on the appellant’ s\\nmobile phone, the high court hesitated to establish a direct connection between those\\nimages and the victim due to a lack of identification. Although the forensic analysis\\nconfirmed the existence of pornographic content to some extent, the court found it\\nchallenging to attribute those specific images to the victim. Nonetheless, the appellant\\nwas convicted under section 67-B of the Information Technology Act, which pertains\\nto the depiction of sexually explicit acts involving children in electronic form. Even\\nthough there was no evidence of the appellant uploading or transmitting these images\\nto anyone else, the act of possessing or depicting children in an obscene, indecent, or\\nsexually explicit manner in electronic form is punishable under clause (b) of section\\n67-B.

The group administrator has the authority to\\nadd or remove members but does not possess the power to regulate or censor content\\nbefore it is posted. The court emphasized that individual members can be held liable\\nfor their own posts if they violate the law . Without specific provisions establishing\\nvicarious liability , an administrator cannot be held responsible for objectionable content\\nposted by group members. The court stated that establishing vicarious liability would\\nrequire demonstrating a common intention or pre-arranged plan between the\\nadministrator and the group member involved. Merely being a group administrator\\ndoes not establish common intention, and it is unreasonable to expect administrators\\nto anticipate or have prior knowledge of the criminal actions of group members.\\nAdditionally , the liability of an administrator as a creator of objectionable content\\ndoes not apply in this case.\\nRegarding the of fense under section 67 of the IT  Act, the court analyzed the\\nspecific language of the section, which punishes the transmission or publication of\\nobscene material in electronic form. The allegations and evidence presented did not\\nsupport the claim that the applicant disseminated or caused the dissemination of any\\nlascivious or obscene material. Section 67 prescribes that an individual may be\\nsubjected to punishment for transmitting, publishing, or causing to be transmitted or\\npublished, any material that is obscene in electronic form. One could discern on a\\ncareful analysis of the allegations in the FIR and the evidence presented in the form\\nof a char ge sheet that there is no claim or evidence that the applicant disseminated or\\ncaused to be disseminated any material in electronic form that is lascivious, appeals\\nto prurient interests, or is likely to corrupt or deprave individuals who may view , read,\\nor hear it. The definition of an intermediary also did not apply to the applicant, as\\nthere was no accusation of involvement in transmitting or receiving any record or\\nproviding related services.\\nAfter reviewing the material in the char ge sheet, it was clear that the essential\\nelements of the alleged of fenses were not disclosed.

It noted that while there are similarities between these provisions, there\\nare also distinct dif ferences in their language and requirements. Specifically , in order\\nfor an act to fall within the scope of section 67 of the IT  Act, it must have the potential\\nto deprave and corrupt individuals who are likely , considering all relevant\\ncircumstances, to read, see, or hear the content in question.\\nTherefore, the court highlighted that the mere publication, transmission, or\\ncausing of publication or transmission in electronic form is not suf ficient to bring an\\nact within the purview of section 67 of the IT  Act. The content must possess a quality\\nthat tends to deprave and corrupt individuals who are likely to come across it. This\\ndistinction is important in determining whether the alleged WhatsApp messages can\\nbe considered an of fence under section 67 of the IT  Act.\\nIn essence, the court emphasized that the content in question should have a\\npotentially harmful impact on the moral and ethical standards of the readers, viewers,\\nor listeners, taking into account all relevant factors. The petitioner ’s argument relied\\non the assertion that the WhatsApp messages did not meet this standard of obscenity\\nor lasciviousness required by section 67 of the IT  Act.

The provision covers publishing,\\ntransmitting, creating, collecting, seeking, browsing, downloading, advertising,\\npromoting, exchanging, or distributing material in any electronic form that depicts\\nchildren engaged in sexually explicit acts. It also includes activities such as cultivating,\\nenticing, or inducing children into online relationships for sexually explicit acts,\\nfacilitating online abuse of children, and recording one’ s own abuse or the abuse of\\nothers involving sexually explicit acts with children. Consequently , viewing child\\npornography is considered an of fense and is punishable under the law .\\nAfter considering the circumstances of the case, the court found that the incident\\noccurred nearly a year ago and it seems to be an isolated incident. Even the prosecution\\ndid not allege that the possession or transmission of the material was for commercial\\npurposes. The court made a distinction between individuals who consume child\\npornography on a one-time basis and those who actively transmit, distribute, or show\\nsuch material in the digital realm. It emphasized the seriousness of the issue and the\\nneed for a strong approach to combat child pornography . The court acknowledged\\nthat once someone enters the digital space, their activities can be monitored by either\\nthe government or the operators of social networking sites. It further highlighted that:43\\nIt is obvious that the moment one steps into digital space, one comes\\nunder the surveillance either of the S tate or those manning the social\\nnetworking sites.

In recent years, intermediaries\\nhave become increasingly significant due to the widespread use of social media\\nplatforms for communication and information sharing. The emer gence of digital media\\nhas also made it a mainstream concern, leading the government to focus on regulating\\nthese platforms. The 2021 Rules represent an initial ef fort to regulate such platforms.\\nThe 2021 IT Rules\\nIn February 2021, the Indian government introduced new regulations for social\\nmedia platforms, digital news media, and other online content providers called the\\nInformation Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code)\\nRules, 2021 (IT  Rules 2021). These rules aim to hold intermediaries more accountable\\nto both internet users and the Indian government. They require social media platforms\\nand messaging apps to appoint Indian residents as grievance of ficers, compliance\\nofficers, and nodal of ficers and to remove content within 36 hours of receiving a\\nlegal order or court directive and maintaining records of all removed content for a\\nminimum of 180 days.\\nThere are also specific rules for publishers of news and current af fairs content\\nand online curated content. Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMI) in\\ncomparison to Social Media Intermediaries (SMI) need to observe additional due\\ndiligence requirements and comply with stringent residency requirements for\\ncompliance of ficers and nodal contact persons.  The rules empower the government\\nto direct intermediaries and publishers to delete, modify , or block content, either\\nthrough a grievance procedure or through emer gency blocking orders passed without\\na hearing.\\nHowever , the rules have faced criticism from human rights groups and digital\\nrights advocates who ar gue that they could be used to suppress free speech and\\nexpression. The rules have also been challenged in petitions filed in dif ferent high\\ncourts including the High Court of Bombay , Kerala, Delhi, and Madras.\\nRule 4(2) of the IT Rules 2021 requires SSMI providing messaging services to\\nenable the identification of the first originator of information on their computer .

The petitioner has ar gued\\nthat the rules’ content moderation requirements could weaken data security and privacy\\nmeasures, ultimately infringing on the right to freedom of trade and profession under\\narticle 19(1)(g) of India’ s constitution.

However , Rule 9 imposes an obligation\\non publishers to adhere to a Code of Ethics that is not part of the IT  Act and may\\npreclude them from criticizing public figures, which the court found problematic as it\\ngoes beyond the powers laid down in section 69A  of the IT  Act:66\\n28. “Dissent in democracy is vital. It is, however , the checks and\\nbalances that make a democracy work. There can be no two opinions\\nthat a healthy democracy is one which has developed on criticism and\\nacceptance of contra views. Opinion based on criticism reinforces its\\nacceptance in a democratic society . For proper administration of the\\nState, it is healthy to invite criticism of all those who are in public\\nservice for the nation to have a structured growth but with the 2021\\nRules in place, one would have to think twice before criticizing any\\nsuch personality , even if the writer/editor/publisher may have good\\nreasons to do so without resorting to defamation and without inviting\\naction under any other provision of law . Allowing the operation of the\\n2021 Rules in its form and substance to operate would result in the\\nwriter/editor/publisher standing the risk of being punished and\\nsanctioned, should the inter -departmental committee be not in favour\\nof criticism of any public figure. It is, therefore, quite possible that the\\nwriter/editor/publisher on contravention of the provisions of clause\\n(1) of Rule 9 of 2021 Rules, but without even transgressing the\\nboundaries set by clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution, may\\nexpose himself/itself to punishment/sanction under the 2021 Rules.\\nThe indeterminate and wide terms of the Rules bring about a chilling\\neffect qua the ight of freedom of speech and expression of writers/\\neditors/publishers because they can be hauled up for anything if such\\ncommittee so wishes. The 2021 Rules are, thus, manifestly unreasonable\\nand go beyond the IT  Act, its aims and provisions.\\n29. A democracy would thrive only if the people of India regulate their\\nconduct in accordance with the preambular promise that they took while\\ngiving to themselves the Constitution.

However , the court did not stay Rule 7 of the 2001 Rules as the petitioner\\nhad not demonstrated that they were an intermediary as defined under section 2(w) of\\nthe IT  Act. The court emphasized that Rule 9 was an exception to the general\\npresumption of subordinate legislation’ s constitutionality and did not comply with\\nthe IT  Act’s provisions or the constitutional rights guaranteed under article 19(1)(a).\\nFinally , the court emphasized that subordinate legislation could not transgress the\\npowers occupied by dif ferent statutes.68\\nIn yet another petition titled Digital News Publishers Assn. v. Union of India69\\nbefore High Court of Madras filed by TM Krishna and Digital News Publishers\\nAssociation (DNP A) against the IT  Rules 2021, which is similar to the High Court of\\nBombay case.70 The court noted that the sub-rules (1) and (3) of Rule 9 of the IT\\nRules 2021 have already been stayed by the High Court of Bombay , and this stay\\norder should have a pan-India ef fect, so there was no need for an independent order .\\nHowever , the petitioners ar gued that they had received notices requiring them to comply\\nwith the IT  Rules and Rule 9. The digital news platforms expressed concern over the\\nthree-tier grievance redressal mechanism, which gives excessive power to government\\nofficials to punish them. This mechanism involves self-regulation by publishers in\\nthe first level, self-regulating bodies established by publishers in the second level,\\nand oversight by the Central Government in the third level. The petitioners were\\nspecifically concerned about sub-clause (x) of Rule 3(1)(b) which states that:71\\n“(x) is patently false and untrue, and is written or published in any\\nform, with the intent to mislead or harass a person, entity or agency for\\nfinancial gain or to cause any injury to any person;”\\nThe petitioners ar gued that this provision, along with the requirement\\nfor intermediaries to terminate access or usage rights for non-\\ncompliance72, and the strict grievance redressal mechanism, creates\\nundue pressure on intermediaries.

       " Document(page_content='2 U.S. Census Bureau\\nWHAT IS HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE?\\nThis brief presents state-level estimates of health insurance coverage \\nusing data from the American Community Survey (ACS). The  \\nU.S. Census Bureau conducts the ACS throughout the year; the \\nsurvey asks respondents to report their coverage at the time of \\ninterview. The resulting measure of health insurance coverage, \\ntherefore, reflects an annual average of current comprehensive \\nhealth insurance coverage status.* This uninsured rate measures a \\ndifferent concept than the measure based on the Current Population \\nSurvey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS ASEC). \\nFor reporting purposes, the ACS broadly classifies health insurance \\ncoverage as private insurance or public insurance. The ACS defines \\nprivate health insurance as a plan provided through an employer \\nor a union, coverage purchased directly by an individual from an \\ninsurance company or through an exchange (such as healthcare.\\ngov), or coverage through TRICARE. Public insurance coverage \\nincludes federal programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the \\nChildren’s Health Insurance Program or CHIP), individual state \\nhealth plans, and CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program \\nat the Department of Veterans Affairs), as well as care provided \\nby the Department of Veterans Affairs. In the ACS, people are \\nconsidered insured if they were covered by any of these types \\nof health insurance at time of interview. People are considered \\nuninsured if they were not covered by any of these types of health \\ninsurance at time of interview or if they only had coverage through \\nthe Indian Health Service (IHS), as IHS coverage is not considered \\ncomprehensive.\\n* Comprehensive health insurance covers basic health care needs. This definition \\nexcludes single-service plans, such as accident, disability, dental, vision, or prescription \\nmedicine plans.The large sample size of the ACS \\nallows for an examination of the \\nuninsured rate and coverage by \\ntype for subnational geographies.8\\nKey Findings\\n• In 2022, the uninsured rate \\nvaried from 2.4 percent in \\nMassachusetts to 16.6 percent \\nin Texas (Figure 1 and Figure \\n2). The District of Columbia \\nwas among the lowest with an \\nuninsured rate of 2.9 percent, \\nnot statistically different from \\nMassachusetts.\\n• Utah and North Dakota reported \\nthe highest rate of private cov -\\nerage (78.4 percent) in 2022, \\nwhile New Mexico had the low -\\nest private coverage rate (54.4 \\npercent) (Figure 3).9\\n• Utah had the lowest rate of \\npublic coverage in 2022 (22.2 \\npercent), and New Mexico had \\nthe highest (Figure 4). \\n• Twenty-seven states had lower \\nuninsured rates in 2022 com -\\npared with 2021.

       " Document(page_content='6 U.S. Census Bureau\\nThe three most populous metro \\nareas (New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago MSAs) had poverty rates in 2022 that were not statistically different from those in 2021. Figure \\n5 provides 2022 poverty rates \\nfor all MSAs with a population of 65,000 or greater. Geographically, MSAs with poverty rates of 20.0 percent or higher were concen-trated in the South.\\n14 Of the 28 \\nmetro areas that were in the high-est poverty rate category, 15 were in the South. Alternatively, metro-politan areas with poverty rates \\nbelow 10.0 percent were more \\nevenly distributed throughout the nation. The West and Northeast had approximately one-quarter of their metro areas in this low pov -\\nerty map category (Figure 5).\\nDEPTH OF POVERTY\\nThe poverty rate is an estimate of the proportion of people with fam-ily or personal income below their poverty threshold. An income-to-poverty ratio evaluates how close \\na family’s or individual’s income \\nis to their poverty threshold. It measures the depth of poverty for those with incomes below their poverty threshold.\\nIn this brief, the income-to-poverty \\nratio is reported as both a per-\\ncentage and ratio. For example, \\nan income-to-poverty-ratio of 125 percent indicates families or individuals with income equal to 1.25 times their poverty threshold, while an income-to-poverty ratio of 50 percent identifies families or individuals with income equal to one-half of their poverty threshold. \\nFamilies and individuals identified \\nas in poverty and described in the preceding sections of this brief had an income-to-poverty ratio of less than 100 percent.\\n14 For more information, refer to  \\n<www.census.gov/geographies/reference-\\nmaps/2010/geo/2010-census-regions-and-\\ndivisions-of-the-united-states.html>.Table 1 for states and Table 2 for \\nmetro areas include several dif-ferent income-to-poverty ratios. This brief provides analysis for two categories, below 50 percent of \\nthe poverty threshold and between \\n100 percent to below 125 percent of the poverty threshold.\\nTable 1 details the proportion of \\npeople with income below 50 percent of their poverty thresh-old in 2022 for the nation, states, \\nthe District of Columbia, and \\nPuerto Rico (refer to Appendix Table 3 for 2021 estimates). The tables also show various other income-to-poverty ratios. The share of the U.S. population with income below 50 percent of their poverty threshold was 6.1 percent in 2022 and showed no statistically \\nsignificant change from 2021. \\nOverall, 10 states and the District \\nof Columbia had a decrease in the proportion of people with an income-to-poverty ratio below 50 percent since 2021. Four states had an increase in the state’s popula-\\ntion living with incomes below \\none-half of their poverty threshold compared to 2021.HOW POVERTY IS MEASURED\\nPoverty status is determined by comparing annual income to a set of dollar values (called poverty thresholds) that vary by family size, number of children, and the age of the householder. If a family’s before-tax money income is less than the dollar value of their threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered \\nto be in poverty. For people not living in families, poverty status \\nis determined by comparing individuals’ income to their poverty threshold.\\nThe poverty thresholds are updated annually to account for changes \\nin the cost of living using the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). They do not vary geographically.\\nPoverty status is determined for individuals in housing units and \\nnoninstitutional group quarters. The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who are not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories or military barracks. Population figures used in this brief reflect this poverty universe.\\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) is a continuous survey, and \\npeople respond throughout the year. Since income is reported for the previous 12 months, the appropriate poverty threshold for each family is determined by multiplying the base-year poverty threshold from 1982 by the average of monthly CPI-U values for the 12 months preceding the survey month. \\nFor more information, refer to page 110 of “American Community \\nSurvey and Puerto Rico Community Survey 2022 Subject Definitions” at <www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/\\ncode-lists.html>.

Several states in the South were among those states with the highest percentage of individuals in this income-to-poverty category.\\nSOURCE AND ACCURACY \\nThe data presented in this brief are based on the ACS and PRCS sample interviewed from January 2021 through December 2021 (2021 ACS and PRCS) and the ACS and \\nPRCS sample interviewed from \\nJanuary 2022 through December 2022 (2022 ACS and PRCS). The estimates based on these samples describe the average values of person, household, and housing unit characteristics over this period of collection. Sampling error is the uncertainty between \\nan estimate based on a sample \\nand the corresponding value that would be obtained if the estimate were based on the entire population (as from a census). Measures of sampling error are provided in the form of margins of error for all estimates included in this brief. All comparative \\nstatements in this brief have \\nundergone statistical testing, and comparisons are significant at the 90 percent confidence level unless otherwise noted. In addition to sampling error, nonsampling error may be introduced during any of the operations used to collect and process survey data such as editing, reviewing, or keying data \\nfrom questionnaires.

The poverty universe excludes children under the age of 15 who \\nare not related to the householder, people living in institutional group quarters (e.g., nursing homes or correctional facilities), and people living in college dormitories \\nor military barracks. People and families are classified as being in poverty if their income is less than their poverty threshold. If their income is less than one-half of their \\npoverty threshold, they are below .50 of poverty; less than the threshold itself, they are in poverty (below 100 percent of poverty); less than 1.25 times the threshold, \\nbelow 125 percent of poverty, and so on.\\n2 Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. A margin of error is a measure of an estimate’s variability. The larger the margin of error in \\nrelation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to or subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval.\\nNote: For information on confidentialty protection, sampling error, nonsampling error, and definitions, refer to < www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-\\ndocumentation/code-lists.html >.\\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, 2021 American Community Survey, 1-year estimates, and 2021 Puerto Rico Community Survey.', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\acsbr-016.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n",

Glanville Williams has given a working definition, without\\nalluding to the subject matter of crime, and has said that “a crime is an act capable of\\nbeing followed by criminal proceedings having a criminal outcome”1 Criminal outcome\\ninvolves stigmatization and possible sentence in the form of punishment. Punishment\\nis considered a legitimate exercise of state power but this power will have to be reigned\\nin lest it becomes an unruly horse. Hence, various procedural protections are guaranteed\\nto the accused and one most important is the presumption of innocence. The\\nproceedings in India are conducted through an adversarial system wherein ordinarily\\nthe burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the char ges leveled against the\\naccused. The presumption of innocence gives a direction to of ficials involved in the\\ncriminal justice process how to deal with the accused. The presumption has no bearing\\non the actual outcome of the case. The substantive and the procedural law complement\\neach other . While substantive criminal law (the Indian Penal Code, 1860) sets out the\\nconduct rules which direct the public to refrain from specified misconduct, the\\nprocedural rules (Criminal Procedure Code, 1973) direct of ficials to investigate and\\nthen prosecute.2 The investigation and prosecution is governed by rules of evidence\\nand circumscribed by the part III of the Constitution. The courts as seats of justice are\\nexpected to sift through the evidence and come to a conclusion of guilt or innocence.\\n The hierarchy of courts is established in order to do complete justice by arriving\\nat the truth. Since courts are manned by human beings (who may inadvertently err),\\nappellate courts are established so that in appeal the evidence and application of laws\\nare further scrutinized  with a singular aim  that the ‘truth’  emer ges and the guilty get\\npunished. It may be axiomatic to mention that the first interface that the public has\\nwith justice delivery mechanism is through the district courts. They are the foundation\\nand pillars on which our justice delivery system is resting and thriving on.

Since courts\\nare expected to give just decisions, appeal mechanisms are integrated in the system to\\nminimize errors. Hence it becomes a cause of concern when appellate courts, while\\ndeciding appeals, pass disparaging remarks on the district judiciary over whom they\\nhave superintendence power only on the administrative side not on the judicial. In a\\ncase the district judiciary had acquitted the accused of a murder char ge. The state\\nwent in appeal and the high court, while reversing the order passed derogatory remarks\\non the trial court verdict which had the potential to seriously undermine its\\nindependence. The apex court while upholding the trial court verdict deprecated the\\npractice of adverse remarks on the trial court verdict and cautioned the high court\\nthus: 3\\nEvery case has its journey towards the truth and it is the Court’ s role to\\nundertake. Truth has to be found on the basis of evidence available\\nbefore it. There is no room for subjectivity nor the nature of the of fence\\naffects its performance. We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with\\ncases. An appellate court shall not expect the trial court to act in a\\nparticular way depending upon the sensitivity of the case. Rather it\\nshould be appreciated if a trial court decides the case on its own merit\\ndespite the sensitivity .\\nThis case needs to be in the course manual of the National Judicial Academy so\\nthat the appellate judiciary does not cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ while sitting in\\nappeal.\\nIt is with these prefatory remarks that the present survey deals with IPC related\\noffences which were decided by the apex court in the year 2021.\\nII OFFENCES AGAINST  HUMAN BODY\\nCulpable homicide\\nMurder is a result crime and issues of causation are very relevant. Additionally ,\\nMacaulay had always advocated for a subjective liability . Hence, for a murder\\nconviction, both these issues become very relevant. In a homicide case the facts were\\nthat, after an altercation over money , the accused pushed the other person and stood\\nover his abdomen causing injuries. The injured was not taken to the hospital till about\\nthe next day and he died there three days later due to septicemia. If one were to apply\\nthe ‘but for ’ test of causation, the septicemia was a result of the injuries but here one\\nalso has to apply the ‘substantial factor ’ test to gauge the causation issues. It is important\\nto understand that “’ substantial’  involves a question of degree depending on the\\nparticular circumstances of the case and may involve a value addition evaluation.”4 In\\nthe instant case, Khokan  v.

The entire factum of the case\\n– the setting, the assault will have to be examined. In Vinod Kumar  v. Amritpal,8  the\\nvictim was forcibly taken in a vehicle and the vehicle was stopped on reaching the\\nunmetalled road. The victim was then taken out of the vehicle and forced on the\\nground and was assaulted. The case clearly fell within the contours of murder under\\nthirdly of section 300 IPC, opined the court.\\nIn Mohd Rafiq  v. State of M.P .9 the apex court engaged in an extensive discussion\\non murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the use of the word\\n‘likely’ in section 304. It finally came to the conclusion that conviction under section\\n302 was not warranted. In the words of the court:10\\n All the essential elements show that the appellant did not have any\\nprevious quarrel with the deceased; there was lack of animus . The act\\nresulting in SI Tiwari’ s death was not premeditated. Though it cannot\\nbe said that there was a quarrel, caused by sudden provocation, if one\\nconsiders that the deceased tried to board the truck, and was perhaps\\nin plain clothes, the instinctive reaction of the appellant was to resist;\\nhe disproportionately reacted, which resulted in the deceased being\\nthrown of f the vehicle. Such act of throwing of f the deceased and\\ndriving on without pausing, appears to have been in the heat of passion,\\nor rage. Therefore, it is held that the appellant’ s conviction under Section\\n302 IPC was not appropriate.\\nHowever , in the very next paragraph the conviction is under section 304 part I\\nas the court opined that “he had the intention of causing such bodily harm, to the\\ndeceased as was likely to result in his death, as it did”.11 It is submitted that if he just\\nwanted to get him of f the truck it would well be a case of knowledge and not intention!\\nThe initial ar guments do not match up with the ultimate conviction.\\nIn a case the prosecution was able to establish that the husband poured kerosene\\nover his wife and set her on fire as per her dying declaration.

The\\ncourts had relied on section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and the last seen theory .\\nHowever , as mentioned in Subramaniams  v. State of T .N.,13 “Ordinarily when the\\nhusband and wife remained within the four walls of a house and death by suicide\\ntakes place it will be for the husband to explain the circumstance in which she might\\nhave died. However , we cannot lose sight of the fact that although the same may be\\nconsidered to be a strong circumstance but that alone in the absence of any evidence\\nof violence on the deceased cannot be held to be conclusive!”14 The apex court in\\nappeal, taking note of this, held that section 106 Evidence Act and the last seen theory\\ndo not absolve the prosecution of dischar ging its primary duty of proving the\\nprosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. The apex court in Shivaji Chintappa Patil\\nv. State of Maharashtra15 set aside the conviction and reiterated that in the case of\\ncircumstantial evidence motive needs to be proved and the prosecution failed to do so\\non all counts.\\nKidnapping\\nIn a case where a child was kidnapped and a ransom demand was made the high\\ncourt af firmed the conviction under section 364-A  which specifically talks about\\nransom. However , the court engaged in a detailed examination of the said section and\\ncame to the conclusion that kidnapping was there, ransom was demanded but another\\nimportant ingredient was missing i.e., “and threatens to cause death or hurt to such\\nperson”. The facts of SK. Ahmed  v. State of T elangana16 revealed that no such threat\\nwas made and the child was looked after well and hence the conviction under section\\n364-A (IPC) was set aside and the appellant was convicted under section 363 IPC and\\nwas sentenced to seven years imprisonment.\\nDacoity\\nThe state is wary of numbers and so stringent punishments are factored in for\\noffences perpetrated by a lar ger group. In Ganesan  v. State,17 the court engaged in a\\ndiscussion on robbery and dacoity and iterated that the only dif ference between robbery\\nand dacoity is the involvement of five or more persons.

The contention\\nin Ram Ratan  v. State of M.P .18 was that since the appellant had not used the firearm\\neven if it is held that the incident had occurred as alleged. The court held that “it is\\nclear that the use of weapon to constitute the of fence under Section 397 IPC does not\\nrequire that the of fender should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a\\nknife or dagger but the mere exhibition of the same. … create fear or apprehension in\\nthe mind of the victim is suf ficient.”19 It is the of fender alone who ‘uses’  the deadly\\nweapon who would be guilty under section 397 and no constructive liability can be\\nimputed under it.\\nSimple hurt\\nEven cases involving simple hurt entailing six months simple imprisonment\\nare contested up to the apex court! It is true that personal liberty is sacrosanct and\\nguaranteed under article 21 but it is submitted that some filtering mechanism will\\nhave to be evolved for matters to reach the constitutional court!20 The court’ s dockets\\nare brimming with cases and some mechanism may have to be devised so that the\\napex court has time to deal with serious cases and timely justice becomes the hallmark\\nof the system.\\nIII OFFENCES AGAINST  WOMEN\\nA love af fair culminating in a secret marriage and the girl being minor the parents\\npress for kidnapping char ges! This has been the fact situation in many a case and the\\npatriarchal families and the patriarchal state are in no mood to relent.

The love af fair among adolescents is, thus, brought under the\\nambit of ‘enticing’, ignoring the fact that it was mutual love, being equal partners in\\nthe crime! Yet, the law char ges the boy who may be 19-21 years of age – himself an\\nadolescent (neo adult)21 – with the severe char ges of kidnapping! The facts of Anversinh\\nv.

The law has failed\\nits children and the courts are not doing any better . The law leaves no scope for the so\\ncalled Romeo-Juliet cases and is out to treat consenting partners – the boy as an\\naccused – and the girl as the victim. In 2015 in a love af fair case in State v. Suman\\nDass,24 the contention of the Delhi Commission for Women was that there shall be\\ntotal prohibition upon teenagers and adolescents from having any kind of sexual\\nrelationship! To this the learned district judge had responded thus: “I am afraid, if\\nthat interpretation is allowed, it would mean that the human body of every individual\\nunder 18 years of age is the property of the S tate and no individual below 18 years of\\nage can be allowed to have the pleasures associated with one’ s body”25 It is humbly\\nsubmitted that this fear has come true in the Aversinh’ s case. The girl having owned\\nup the love af fair - “The prosecutrix nevertheless admitted during cross-examination\\nto being in love with the appellant, having had consensual sexual intercourse with\\nhim on a prior date and also having met him outside her home on previous occasions”,26\\nwas then under the control of the patriarchal family and she changed her stance. In a\\nvery problematic way the high court distinguished this case from that of S.\\nVaradarajan27 saying that in that case it was voluntary abandonment:28\\n[T]he High Court has acknowledged that there was a love af fair,\\nfrequent meetings, and consensual relationship between the parties,\\nwhich merited the appellant’ s acquittal under Section 376 IPC. But in\\nthe very same breath, the High Court has also held [ Anvarsinh  v. State\\nof Gujarat , 2009 SCC OnLine Guj 6145] that the prosecutrix did not\\nwillingly leave her parents’ custody and had not consented to be taken\\nfor marriage. These two findings were canvassed as being mutually\\ncontradictory .\\nThe moot question is, did the court come down from its high pedestal to enquire\\nfrom the girl whether she was enticed or she voluntarily abandoned the care of her\\nguardian? The court in its magnanimity reduced the sentence to the period already\\nunder gone, but what about the stigma of criminality which got attached to the boy in\\na consensual love af fair?

State of Har yana29\\nthat the phrase “soon before” as appearing in section 304B IPC is not “immediately\\nbefore” but it is enough that the prosecution establishes the existence of “proximate\\nand close link” between the dowry death and cruelty!30 The court also raised a concern\\nregarding recording of statements under section 313 Cr PC in a casual manner by the\\ntrial courts thereby denying the very purpose of this important provision which enables\\nthe accused to of fer an explanation for the incriminatory materials appearing against\\nhim. The same view was reiterated in another dowry death case in Gurmeet Singh  v.\\nState of Punjab .31\\nIn a case where the woman went missing from the matrimonial home and there\\nwere dowry allegations also and the body was recovered from the banks of the river ,\\na presumption was raised against the husband under section 1 13B of the Evidence\\nAct. The court in Parvati Devi  v. State of Jharkhand32  held that the “circumstances\\nput together , unerringly point to his guilt in extinguishing the life of a wife within few\\nmonths of the marriage on her failing to satisfy the demands of dowry” and convicted\\nthe husband under sections 304B and 201 IPC.\\nSkin to skin contact\\nIn a case of sexual assault the special court convicted and sentenced the accused\\nSatish for of fences under sections 342, 354 and 363 of IPC 1860 and section 8 of the\\nProtection of Children from Sexual Of fences Act, 2012. The accused preferred an\\nappeal and the Nagpur Bench of the High Court of Bombay disposed of f the appeal\\nby acquitting him of section 8 of the POCSO, Act and convicting him for the of fence\\nunder sections 342 and 354 IPC. The judge while acquitting him of POCSO char ge\\nfactored in a very controversial issue and observed that “admittedly it is not the case\\nof the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such,\\nthere is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without\\npenetration”33 This observation caused a national outrage and the Attorney General of\\nIndia, the National Commission for Women and the S tate of Maharashtra filed appeals\\nbefore the apex court and the court through Bela Trivedi J., dealt with the provisions\\nof the POCSO Act threadbare. The court engaged with the objects and reasons for the\\nenactment of the Act and also the Constitution and the Convention of the Right of the\\nChild came to the conclusion that:34\\nThe interpretation of Section 7 at the instance of the High Court on the\\npremise of the principle of “ ejusdem generis ” is also thoroughly\\nmisconceived.

So far as Section 7 of the POCSO  Act is concerned, the first part\\nthereof exhausts a class of act of sexual assault using specific words,\\nand the other part uses the general act beyond the class denoted by the\\nspecific words. In other words, whoever , with sexual intent touches\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person,\\nwould be committing an of fence of “sexual assault”. Similarly , whoever\\ndoes any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact\\nwithout penetration, would also be committing the of fence of “sexual\\nassault” under Section 7 of the POCSO  Act. In view of the discussion\\nmade earlier , the prosecution was not required to prove a “skin-to-\\nskin” contact for the purpose of proving the char ge of sexual assault\\nunder Section 7 of the Act.\\nRavindra Bhat J., gave a concurring judgment deftly engaging with the embedded\\npatriarchal notions in IPC of fences like outraging the modesty of a woman. The\\nmandatory minimum was sought to be justified in the judgment given the severity of\\nthe crime and the status of a vulnerable child victim. The court held the accused liable\\nfor sexual assault under section 7 of the POCSO Act punishable under section 8 of\\nthe same and other provisions of the IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment\\nfor three years. However , the judges having taken the dif ficult path of questioning the\\npatriarchy could have also dealt with the problematic aspects of the legislation wherein\\nthe consensual cases also fall in the crime category as the definition of child varies\\nfrom 0-18! And the rigour of the POCSO Act does away with the presumption of\\ninnocence giving way to statutory presumption under section 29 of the POCSO Act.\\nThe Act mandates that the accused has to dischar ge this presumption beyond reasonable\\ndoubt. And this has to be accomplished factoring in a very important provision\\ncontained in section 33(6) of the Act which prohibits aggressive questioning or\\ncharacter assassination of a child. This is indeed necessary so that the victim child is\\nguarded against further victimization.  But when looked from the perspective of a\\nframed accused this also becomes a serious issue as he has to put up a spirited defence.\\nAnd, to top it all, the sentencing discretion has been done away with by incorporating\\nmandatory minimum in the Act.

They\\nspecifically pleaded that there is no one to take care of their minor son\\nand old age parents.\\nIntersectionality\\nThe judgment in Patan Jamal V ali v. State of A.P37 is akin to reading a research\\npaper on intersectionality of violence, gender , caste and disability . The judgment by\\nChandrached J is divided into topics and sub topics (a pattern that the judge has been\\nfollowing) to make it more reader friendly . The judgment unpacks gender , caste and\\ndisability and intersectionality very eloquently in a case of rape of a visually challenged\\ngirl belonging to the SC community . The court made a very apt observation:38\\n Intersectionality merely ur ges us to have “an open-textured legal\\napproach that would examine underlying structures of inequality”. This\\nrequires us to analyse law in its social and economic context allowing\\nus to formulate questions of equality as that of “power and\\npowerlessness” instead of dif ference and sameness. The latter being a\\nconceptual limitation of single axis analysis, it may allow certain\\nintersectional claims to fall through the cracks since such claims are\\nnot unidirectional in nature.\\nFurther , engaging with disability the court remarked:39\\nThis kind of a judicial attitude stems from and perpetuates the\\nunderlying bias and stereotypes against persons with disabilities. We\\nare of the view that the testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability , or\\nof a disabled witness for that matter , cannot be considered weak or\\ninferior , only because such an individual interacts with the world in a\\ndifferent manner , vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. As long as\\nthe testimony of such a witness otherwise meets the criteria for inspiring\\njudicial confidence, it is entitled to full legal weight. It goes without\\nsaying that the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive\\nto the fact that the witness’ disability can have the consequence of the\\ntestimony being rendered in a dif ferent form, relative to that of an\\nable-bodied witness. In the case at hand, for instance, PW2’ s blindness\\nmeant that she had no visual contact with the world. Her primary mode\\nof identifying those around her , therefore, is by the sound of their voice.\\nAnd so PW2’ s testimony is entitled to equal weight as that of a\\nprosecutrix who would have been able to visually identify the appellant.\\nThe court upholding life sentence on char ge of rape under section 376 IPC\\nexplained that it is dif ficult and artificial to delineate the many dif ferent identities of', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\008-Criminal Law.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

The court in Indrapal Singh  v. State of U.P .41\\nreiterated that “in absence of a common intention even if several persons simultaneously\\nattack the man each one of them would be individually liable for whatever injury he\\ncaused and none would be vicariously convicted for the act of any or the other”.42 The\\nprosecution does not have to prove that there was an elaborate plan between the\\naccused to kill the deceased or a plan was in existence for a long time. A common\\nintention to commit the crime is proved if the accused by their words or action indicate\\ntheir assent to join in the commission of crime.43\\nRavinder Bhat J in Netaji Achyut Shinde (Patil)  v. State44  explained the concept\\nof constructive liability very succinctly by saying that when the physical presence of\\nthe two accused was established and evidence was led by way of independent witnesses\\nthat they facilitated the crime that clearly shows that there was a “consensus of the\\nmind of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular act”.45\\nCommon object\\nIn India caste dynamics run unabated in spite of progress in other fronts. And\\nespecially where marriages are concerned the communities remain totally embedded\\nin issues of caste. In a case46 a boy and a girl belonging to dif ferent caste wanted to\\nmarry .  A panchayat was convened and the girl from the Jat community made her\\nintention clear of marrying her lover who belonged to the Jatav  community . This\\ninfuriated the Jat community and they ordered that the boy and another boy who\\naccompanied the couple be hung upside down and their private parts be burned. This\\nwas not the end of the macabre show . These two boys along with the girl were ordered\\nto be hanged to death and they were taken to a ‘Banyan Tree’, and the parents of the\\nthree youngsters were forced to pull the rope to strangulate them! 35 people were\\nconvicted by the trial court and in appeal the high court acquitted two persons.

If an unlawful assembly is formed with\\nthe common object of committing an of fence, and if that of fence is\\ncommitted in prosecution of the object by any member of the unlawful\\nassembly , all the members of the assembly will be vicariously liable\\nfor that of fence even if one or more, but not all committed the of fence.\\nAgain, if an of fence is committed by a member of an unlawful assembly\\nand that of fence is one which the members of the unlawful assembly\\nknew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object,\\nevery member who had that knowledge will be guilty of the of fence so\\ncommitted. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove each of the\\nmembers’ involvement especially regarding which or what act ( Masalti\\nsupra). While overt act and active participation may indicate common\\nintention of the person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the\\nunlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminal liability under\\nSection 149 .\\nV INCHOA TE OFFENCES\\nAttempt\\nThe line between preparation and attempt is very thin. However , a careful analysis\\ndoes lay the distinction bare. In a case a minor girl was lured into a room and the\\naccused rubbed his genitals against the child and the child started crying. It was a\\nclear case of attempt to rape and the apex court rightly called the high court order\\ncalling the act as preparation to rape  as ‘perverse and untenable’ and convicted the\\naccused under section 376 read with section  51 1 IPC in State of M.P  v. Mahendra .48\\nAbetment\\nOne of the duties of the school and the teachers also is to discipline children\\nand inculcate good habits in them and this may require some kind of reprimand. In\\nthis case a child was reprimanded by a teacher for repeatedly bunking classes and his\\nparents were called. The child committed suicide that night and was found hanging at\\n4 a.m. The physical training instructor was char ged and convicted by the high court\\nfor abetment of suicide.

In a case where the woman committed suicide within two years of\\nmarriage and the of fence of cruelty stood proved the court presumed that it was a case\\nof abetment. The presumption can be rebutted and since no material was brought on\\nrecord to disprove this presumption the high court conviction under sections 498A\\nand 306 IPC was upheld in Gurmansinh  v. State of Gujarat.51\\nMere harassment without any positive action on the part of the accused proximate\\nto the time of the occurrence of the suicide would not amount to an of fence under\\nsection 306 IPC.52\\nThe court reiterated in Bhagwanrao Mahadeo Patil  v. Appa Ramchandra\\nSavkar53 that section 306 IPC is broader in its application and one aspect of it is\\nsection 304B. If a conviction for causing a suicide is based on section 304B IPC,\\nwhich is a dowry death provision, it will necessarily attract section 306 IPC.

Similarly , in Sy Azhar Sy Kalander  v State of\\nMaharashtra57 the court taking into consideration, inter alia, the compromise entered\\ninto between the two parties while upholding the conviction under section 307 IPC\\nreduced the quantum of punishment to five years.

The fact that 28 years had elapsed and the families\\nwere now on cordial terms did not move the court to give any benefit of the alleged\\ncompromise! The victim was leading his life with a prosthetic arm and leg as a result\\nof the assault which made him permanently disabled.\\nThere has been a trend that in some of the cases the courts factor in the possibility\\nof future crimes while deciding the quantum of sentence. In a case of rape the court in\\nManoj Mishra  v. State of U.P59 gave seven years imprisonment (as one it was a pre\\n2018 case so minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years was not attracted) The discretion\\nwas to give the sentence ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. The court\\nobserved “taking into consideration all facts including that no material is available on\\nrecord to indicate that the appellant has any criminal antecedents and that he is also a\\nfather of five children ….., it appears that there is no reason to apprehend that the\\nappellant would indulge in similar acts in future”? 60.\\nIf consensual sex was the consideration, the court did not mention that.   Since\\nthe girl was minor , it was a case of statutory rape. Therefore, the reasoning of the\\ncourt begs a question that why then in certain cases stricter punishments are awarded\\nkeeping the deterrence theory in mind – that it will deter others? It would be very\\nhumane if the judges were to examine this aspect in each case whether the accused\\nhas a proclivity for further crimes.\\nIn a case where the right of private defense was exceeded the court took note of\\nthe fact that the complainants’ family members were the aggressors and they had tried\\nto disturb the peaceful possession of the accused from the land. The court upheld the\\nconviction under section 304 part II, reduced the quantum of sentence to two years\\nrigorous imprisonment and Rs. 5000 /-fine.61\\nReview petition\\nA review petition was filed in Mofil Khan  v. State of Jharkhand 62 wherein it\\ngot listed to be heard in the  open court since death penalty was awarded to the\\npetitioners by the trial court which was upheld by the high court. The court made it\\nclear that the only jurisdiction in a review petition is to see if there has been a patent\\nmistake or glaring omission due to judicial fallibility . The court did not find any such\\nreason to interfere in the instant case. However , the court took note of the fact that\\nthere is a possibility of reformation and rehabilitation.

This position was reiterated by the Supreme\\nCourt in Krishna Lal Chawla v. State of U.P .2\\nIn Lalita Kumari  v.

State of Karnataka,5 the Supreme Court criticised\\nthe investigating of ficer for his failure to close a man missing case instituted on\\ninformation given by parent of a girl after the girl who went missing informed him\\nthat she had married another man. The court took exception to the conduct of the\\ninvestigating of ficer in insisting the girl to report at the police station for recording\\nher statement. According to the court, consent of the family or the community or the\\nclan is not necessary once two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that\\ntheir consent has to be piously given primacy .

According to the\\nCourt the power of the Magistrate under section 156 (3) CrPC. to order investigation\\nby the police is not touched or af fected by section 202 Cr PC. The investigation\\nwhich the magistrate can direct under section 202(1) either by a police of ficer or by\\nany other person is for a limited purpose of enabling the magistrate to decide whether\\nor not there is suf ficient ground to proceed further . The power under Section 156(3)\\ncan be exercised by the magistrate even before he takes cognizance provided the\\ncomplaint discloses the commission of cognizable of fence.\\nIn Sidhar th v.

The court also pointed out the distinction\\nbetween the existence of power to arrest and justification for exercise of that power .\\nIt observed:10\\n……….  personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional\\nmandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises\\nwhen custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime\\nor where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused\\nmay abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful\\ndoes not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made\\nbetween the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for\\nexercise of it. If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm\\nto the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the investigating of ficer\\nhas no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey\\nsummons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation\\nwe fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the of ficer\\nto arrest the accused.\\nIn Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay Sharma,11the Supreme Court reiterated the procedure\\nto be followed when there is a complaint and police investigation in respect of the\\nsame of fence. According to the court there is no bar to lodge an FIR when a complaint\\nhas been filed earlier on the same set of facts with the same set of allegations and\\naverments.\\nThe Supreme Court and high courts are ‘sentinels of justice’ that ensure that\\nrule of law and constitutional guarantees of a fair and impartial investigation are\\nupheld. While investigating of fences justice must not only be done but also be seen\\nand perceived to be done. In the past the Supreme Court has made creative interventions\\nto ensure fairness in investigations by taking steps for monitoring investigations by\\npolice on a daily basis. Such an intervention was made by the Supreme Court during\\nthe period covered by this survey . The Supreme Court was seized of the In re Violence\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh) Leading to Loss of Life12 matter when two lawyers\\nwrote to the court seeking an independent inquiry into an incident in which several\\npeople who were protesting against the Agricultural Acts of 2020 were rammed from\\nbehind and run over by a vehicle resulting in eight deaths and injury to several others.\\nEver since then, the case was investigated by a Special Investigation Team which\\nessentially comprised of middle level/subordinate level of ficers of U.P . police posted\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri district. When the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court on\\nvarious occasions some of the parties questioned the fairness of the investigation\\nconducted by the SIT .

State of M.P .14, the Supreme Court modified an order passed\\nby the Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court whereby the high court had\\ngranted anticipatory bail to an accused subject to the condition of deposit of Rs 41\\nlakhs in court and upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 with\\none solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting of ficer. While\\nissuing the said order the high court had further directed that the order would be\\ngoverned by conditions 1 to 3 of sub-section (2) of section 438 of the Cr PC. The trial\\ncourt was also directed to deposit the amount so deposited by the appellant with any\\nnationalised bank.The Supreme Court expressed the view that by imposing the\\ncondition of deposit of Rs 41 lakhs, the high court has, in an application for pre-arrest\\nbail under section 438 of the Cr PC, virtually issued directions in the nature of recovery\\nin a civil suit. The court clarified:15\\nIt is well settled by a plethora of decisions of this Court that criminal\\nproceedings are not for realisation of disputed dues. It is open to a\\ncourt to grant or refuse the prayer for anticipatory bail, depending on\\nthe facts and circumstances of the particular case. The factors to be\\ntaken into consideration, while considering an application for bail are\\nthe nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case\\nof conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the\\nprosecution; reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses\\nor apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; reasonable\\npossibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial\\nor the likelihood of his abscondence; character , behaviour and standing\\nof the accused; and the circumstances which are peculiar or the accused\\nand lar ger interest of the public or the S tate and similar other\\nconsiderations. A criminal court, exercising jurisdiction to grant bail/\\nanticipatory bail, is not expected to act as a recovery agent to realise\\nthe dues of the complainant, and that too, without any trial.\\nWith a view to avoid unnecessary bail matters reaching the court, the Supreme\\nCourt in Satender Kumar Antil v.

State\\n(NCT of Delhi),19 and guided by the consideration of nature and gravity of the alleged\\noffence, the Supreme Court in Supreme Bhiwandi W ada Manor Infrastr uctur e (P)\\nLtd. v. State of Maharashtra ,20 set aside an order granting anticipatory bail to an\\naccused who was alleged to have fraudulently misappropriated amounts intended to\\nbe paid by a company to the farmers af fected by the work of road widening. The court\\nexpressed the view that the order granting anticipatory bail suf fered from serious\\ninfirmities resulting in miscarriage of justice.\\nNon-compliance with the procedure contained in section 41 CrPC before\\narresting an accused, as adumbrated in the judgment in Arnesh Kumar  v. State of\\nBihar ,21 was taken as a factor for releasing him on interim bail.22\\nIn Union of India v . K.A. Najeeb,23 the Supreme Court emphasised on the need\\nfor harmonising the restrictions in the matter of grant of bail imposed by a statute as\\nwell as the powers exercisable under constitutional jurisdiction. According to the\\nCourt, statutory restrictions like Section 43-D(5) of the UAP A per se does not oust\\nthe power of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part III\\nof the Constitution. At commencement of proceedings, the courts are expected to\\nappreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions\\nwill melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable\\ntime and the period of incarceration already under gone has exceeded a substantial\\npart of the prescribed sentence.\\nReasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision-\\nmaking process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial\\nand even by administrative bodies.Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised\\nby the decision-maker on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous\\nconsiderations.Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability\\nand transparency . Time and again the Supreme Court has emphasised the need for\\nassigning reasons while issuing an order granting bail to an accused. In Brijmani\\nDevi v.

Pankaj Jagshi Gangar ,27the Supreme Court deprecated\\nthe tendency of certain accused to go for forum-shopping in the matter of bail. In this\\ncase a person accused of of fences under MCOCA  filed an appeal before a single\\njudge of high court against the order of a special judge. While the bail application\\nwas pending before the single judge, the accused sensing that the judge was not inclined\\nto grant bail, withdrew the appeal and thereafter preferred a writ petition before a\\ndivision bench of the high court under the guise of challenging the vires of MCOCA.\\nWithout being aware of what transpired earlier , the division bench released the accused\\non bail and that too by way of interim relief. The Supreme Court referred to this as an\\ninstance of forum shopping and described it as a conduct which cannot be approved.\\nThe order passed by the division bench of the high court was therefore quashed and\\nset aside by the Supreme Court.\\nIn Enfor cement Dir ectorate, Government of India  v.

In Ramesh Bhavan\\nRathod35 the court also expressed its disapproval at the observation of the High Court\\nthat the grant of bail to one accused shall not be considered as a precedent for any\\nother person who is accused in the FIR on grounds of parity .

This would not only save judicial time that comes\\nat the cost of public money , but would also protect the right to liberty that every\\nperson is entitled to under Article 21 of the Constitution.\\nVI SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION\\nThe Cr PC treats public servants as a special category in order to protect them\\nfrom malicious or vexatious prosecutions. Section 197 of the Code seeks to protect\\nan of ficer who is accused of an of fence committed while acting or purporting to act in\\nthe dischar ge of his of ficial duties from unnecessary harassment. It prohibits the court\\nfrom taking cognisance of such of fence except with the previous sanction of the\\ncompetent authority . On earlier occasions the Supreme Court has held that section\\n197 Cr PC should be construed in such a manner as to advance the cause of honesty ,\\njustice and good governance.46 In Indra Devi v. State of Rajasthan ,47 the Supreme\\nCourt had an opportunity to summarise the principle to be applied while determining\\nwhether sanction under section 197 Cr PC is required or not. According to the court,\\nsanction under section 197 Cr PC is necessary if the of fence alleged against the public\\nservant is committed by him “while acting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his\\nofficial duty” and in order to find out whether the alleged of fence is committed “while\\nacting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his of ficial duty”, the yardstick to be\\nfollowed is to form a prima facie  view whether the act of omission for which the\\naccused was char ged had a reasonable connection with the dischar ge of his duties.\\nVII WITNESS PROTECTION\\nFor instance, In Re V iolence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) Leading to Loss of Life48\\nthe Supreme Court directed the state government to provide protection to all witnesses\\nconnected with the case as per the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.\\nVIII FRAMING OF CHARGE\\nThe factors to be considered at the time of framing of char ge were reiterated\\nand summarised in State of Rajasthan  v. Ashok Kumar Kashyap.49\\nIX TRANSFER OF CRIMINAL  CASES\\nTime and again the courts have observed that no hard and fast rule can be\\nprescribed for deciding a transfer petition which will always have to be decided on\\nthe facts of each case. Convenience for the purposes of transfer means the convenience\\nof the prosecution, other accused, the witnesses and the lar ger interest of the\\nsociety .Convenience of a party may be one of the relevant considerations but cannot\\noverride all other considerations such as the availability of witnesses exclusively at\\nthe original place, making it virtually impossible to continue with the trial at the place\\nof transfer , and progress of which would naturally be impeded for that reason at the\\n46 Subramanian Swamy v.

State (NCT  of Delhi),50 the Supreme\\nCourt refused to transfer a criminal case from Delhi to Allahabad (Prayagraj) on the\\nground that most of the prosecution witnesses were located at Delhi. According to the\\ncourt, if the transfer petition is allowed, the witnesses would be required to travel\\nfrom Delhi to Allahabad, which in turn would cause hindrance in performing their\\nofficial duties.\\nX EXERCISE OF INHERENT POWERS\\nThe inherent jurisdiction under section 482 Cr PC is designed to achieve the\\nsalutary purpose that criminal proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate\\ninto weapon of harassment. While quashing an FIR in Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay\\nSharma,51the Supreme Court reiterated the settled position that criminal proceedings\\ncan be quashed when the court is satisfied that such proceedings amount to an abuse\\nof process of law or that it amounts to bringing pressure upon the accused. A litigant\\npursuing frivolous and vexatious proceedings cannot claim unlimited right upon court\\ntime and public money to achieve his ends. It has therefore been held that the inherent\\npower can be exercised by the court to deny any relief to a litigant who attempts to\\npollute the stream of justice by coming to it with his unclean hands.52\\nThe question whether an interim order of no coercive steps during proceedings\\nunder section 482 Cr PC and/or under article 226 of the Constitution of India could\\nbe passed by the High Court was addressed by the Supreme Court in two judgments\\npronounced during the period covered by the survey . In Neeharika Infrastr uctur e\\nPrivate Ltd.  v. State of Maharashtra53the Supreme Court frowned upon the tendency\\nof the courts to pass blanket, cryptic, laconic, non-speaking orders reading “ no coer cive\\nsteps shall be adopted ”.However , it allowed space for the high court to pass such\\norders “ in exceptional cases with caution and cir cumspection, giving brief r easons ”.\\nSubsequently in Siddhar thMukesh Bhandari v. State of Gujarat,54 the court while\\nreiterating the position taken in Neeharika Infrastr uctur e55 noted:56\\nAn interim order of stay of investigation during the pendency of the\\nquashing petition can be passed with circumspection. Such an interim\\norder should not require to be passed routinely , casually and/or\\nmechanically . Normally , when the investigation is in progress and the\\nfacts are hazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High\\nCourt, the High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim\\norder of not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” and the\\naccused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under Section\\n438CrPC before the competent court.

Mahesh Coop. Urban bank Shar eholders W elfare Assn. v.

State of Punjab,60 the Supreme Court summarised the law\\nrelating to the requisite tests to be applied by the trial court while applying the principles\\nenunciated in section 218 to 223 Cr PC. i.e., while taking an appropriate decision on\\nwhether there should be a joint or separate trial.  The two-pronged test that should be\\napplied by the trial court is (a) whether conducting a joint/separate trial will prejudice\\nthe defence of the accused and/or (b) whether conducting a joint/separate trail would\\ncause judicial delay .\\nThe Supreme Court has consistently taken the position that a retrial or a de\\nnovo trial should be th e last resort and that too when such a course becomes desperately\\n57 (2021) 9 SCC 152.\\n58 Neeharika Infrastr uctur e Private Ltd.  v.

A retrial should be limited to the extreme exigency to avert a “failure\\nof justice”. In Nasib Singh ,61 the court also had the occasion to summarise the principles\\nthat emer ge from the various judicial pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the\\nmatter of ordering retrials. The principles are enumerated below:62\\ni.The appellate court may direct a retrial only in “exceptional” circumstances\\nto avert a miscarriage of justice.\\nii.Mere lapses in the investigation are not suf ficient to warrant a direction\\nfor retrial. Only if the lapses are so grave so as to prejudice the rights of\\nthe parties, can a retrial be directed.\\niii.A determination of whether a “shoddy” investigation/trial has prejudiced\\nthe party , must be based on the facts of each case pursuant to a thorough\\nreading of the evidence.\\niv.It is not suf ficient if the accused/prosecution makes a facial ar gument that\\nthere has been a miscarriage of justice warranting a retrial. It is incumbent\\non the appellate court directing a retrial to provide a reasoned order on the\\nnature of the miscarriage of justice caused with reference to the evidence\\nand investigatory process.\\nThe aim of every court is to discover the truth. Section 31 1 Cr PC is one of the\\nprovisions which strengthen the arms of a court in its ef fort to unearth the truth by\\nprocedure sanctioned by law . In V. N. Patil  v. K. Niranjan Kumar63 the Supreme Court\\nwhile summarising the principles relating to object and scope of section 31 1 Cr PC\\nheld that the discretionary power vested in the courts has to be exercised judiciously\\nfor strong and valid reasons and with caution and circumspection to meet the ends of\\njustice.\\nXI POWER TO PROCEED AGAINST  OTHER PERSONS\\nThe position regarding the exercise of power under section 319 Cr PC i.e.,\\npower to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of of fence was clarified\\nby a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court as early as in 2014.64 In Ramesh Chandra\\nSrivastava v. State of U.P .65 a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court reiterated the\\nposition as laid down in Hardeep Singh66 and held that the power under section 319\\nCr PC should be exercised only when strong and cogent evidence occurs against a\\nperson from the evidence. In the instant case the Sessions Judge had exercised the\\npower under section 319 Cr PC in a casual and cavalier manner . The order of the\\nsessions judge was unsuccessfully challenged before the High Court. While allowing\\nan appeal by special leave the Supreme Court set aside the order passed by the sessions\\njudge and directed him to apply his mind in the light of the principles laid down by\\n61 Nasib Singh v. State of Punjab , (2022) 2 SCC 89.\\n62 Nasib Singh v. State of Punjab , (2022) 2 SCC 89, para 33.\\n63 (2021) 3 SCC 661.\\n64 Hardeep Singh  v.

Further a person not named in the FIR or a person though named in the\\nFIR but has not been char ge-sheeted or a person who has been dischar ged can be\\nsummoned under section 319 Cr PC, provided from the evidenceit appears that such\\nperson can be tried along with the accused already facing trial.\\nIn Ajay Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand,69 the Supreme Court further reminded\\nthat the power under section 319 Cr PC is a discretionary and extraordinary power\\nwhich is to be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of\\nthe case so warrant.\\nXII APPEALS\\nWhile considering an appeal against conviction, the Supreme Court, in Samaul\\nS. K.  v. State of Jharkhand,70used the voluntary initiative of the accused to pay an\\namount of Rs. 3 lakhs for the benefit of the victim and her children as a ground to\\nreduce the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment for an of fence under section\\n498A to seven months imprisonment which was the period of incarceration already\\nunder gone by him on the date of the order .\\nThe scope of the power of a court considering an appeal against acquittal was\\nclarified further in Jayamma v. State of Karnataka.71 According to the Supreme Court,\\nunless the high court finds that there is complete misreading of the material evidence\\nwhich has led to miscarriage of justice, the view taken by the trial court which can\\nalso possibly be a correct view , need not be interfered with. This self-restraint doctrine,\\nof course, does not denude the high court of its powers to reappreciate the evidence,\\nincluding in an appeal against acquittal and arrive at a dif ferentfinding of fact.\\nWhile discussing the scope of the powers of an appellate court dealing with an\\nappeal against acquittal, the Supreme Court in Achhar Singh v. State of H.P .72 held\\nthat though it is a well-crystallised principle that if two views are possible, the High\\nCourt ought not to interfere with the trial court’ s judgment, such a precautionary\\nprinciple cannot be overstretched to portray that the “ contours of appeal ” against\\nacquittal under Section 378 Cr PC are limited to seeing whether or not the trial court’ s\\nview was impos sible.\\n67 Hardeep Singh  v.

State of Punjab,73 the Supreme Court had identified the\\nanti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime as one of the factors that may be\\ntaken into account by the court for imposition of death sentence. In Hari  v. State of\\nUttar Pradesh74decided during the period covered by the survey the Court held that\\nthe ghastly murders of three youngsters which are honour killings squarely falls under\\nthe head of anti-social and abhorrent nature of the crime as mentioned in Machi Singh .75\\nIn Bhagchandra  v. State of Madhya Pradesh76Supreme Court converted the\\ndeath sentence awarded to a convict who murdered two of his siblings and one nephew\\nto life imprisonment for a period of two years. The court noted:77\\nIn view of the settled legal position, it is our bounden duty to take into\\nconsideration the probability of the accused being reformed and\\nrehabilitated. It is also our duty to take into consideration not only the\\ncrime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio-economic\\nconditions. The deceased as well as the appellant are rustic villagers.\\nIn a property dispute, the appellant has got done away with two of his\\nsiblings and a nephew . The S tate has not placed on record any evidence\\nto show that there is no possibility with respect to reformation or\\nrehabilitation of the convict. …………………………………………\\nThe appellant comes from a rural and economically poor background.\\nThere are no criminal antecedents. The appellant cannot be said to be\\na hardened criminal. This is the first of fence committed by the appellant,\\nno doubt, a heinous one.

It cannot therefore be said that there is no possibility of\\nthe appellant being reformed and rehabilitated foreclosing the\\nalternative option of a lesser sentence and making imposition of death\\nsentence imperative.\\nIn another case78 the court commuted the death sentence awarded to a convict\\nfor the of fence punishable under section 302 IPC to one of life imprisonment on the\\nfollowing grounds:79\\nThe appellant is a young person, who was 23 years old at the time of\\ncommission of the of fence.

It therefore cannot be said\\nthat there is no possibility of the appellant being reformed and\\nrehabilitated foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and\\nmaking imposition of death sentence imperative.\\nOn earlier occasions, through decisions such as Muthuramalingam,80 O. M.\\nCherian81 and Nagaraja Rao82the Supreme Court has clarified that while awarding\\nmultiple sentences a court of first instance is under a legal obligation to specify in\\nclear terms as to whether they would run concurrently or consecutively and that\\nsentences awarded by a court for several of fences committed by a convict shall run\\nconsecutively unless otherwise directed by the court. In Sunil Kumar v . State of U.P .83the\\nSupreme Court came across a situation where not only the trial court but also the\\nHigh Court omitted to specify whether the sentences awarded to the convicts shall\\nrun concurrently or consecutively . Though it observed that the omissions will not, by\\nthemselves, provide a room for concurrent running of sentences, the Court keeping in\\nview the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case invoked its power under Article\\n142 so as to modify the punishment awarded to the convicts in the manner that the\\nmaximum period of imprisonment to be served by them in relation to of fences in\\nquestion shall be 14 years and not beyond.\\nXIV REMISSION OF SENTENCES\\nIn State of Har yana v. Raj Kumar ,84 the Supreme Court had an opportunity to\\naddress the nature and scope of power of the Governor under article 161 of Constitution\\nof India and the manner in which the said power was to be exercised. Holding that the\\nrestrictions under section 433-A cannot apply to the constitutional power under article\\n161 of the Constitution of India, the court observed:85\\n[t]he power of the appropriate Government to release a prisoner after\\nserving 14 years of actual imprisonment is vested with the S tate\\nGovernment.

Thus, if a prisoner has under gone more than 14 years of actual\\nimprisonment, the S tate Government, as an appropriate Government,\\nis competent to pass an order of premature release, but if the prisoner\\nhas not under gone 14 years or more of actual imprisonment, the\\nGovernor has a power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites and\\nremissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence\\nof any person dehors the restrictions imposed under Section 433-A of\\nthe Constitution. Such power is in exercise of the power of the\\nsovereign, though the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice\\nof the S tate Government.\\nXV SAFEGAURDING RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME\\nIn X v. State of Jharkhand,86 the Supreme Court after referring to its own\\njudgment in NipunSaxena  v. Union of India,87 reminded the media of its obligation to\\nnot print or publish the name of the rape victims or even in a remote manner disclose\\nany facts which can lead to the suchvictims being identified.\\nXVI COMPOUNDING OF OFFENCES\\nThe mere fact that an of fence is compoundable with consent of the court need\\nnot persuade the court to automatically or mechanically exercise the power of\\ncompounding. Nature of the of fence and its ef fect on society are relevant\\nconsiderations, which the court must consider carefully while determining whether\\nleave to compound of fence is to be granted or not. Thus, in Pravat Chandra Mohanty\\nv. State of Odisha,88 the Supreme Court observed that of fences involving police\\nbrutalities are crimes not only against the victims but also against humanity and hence\\npermission for compounding of such of fences cannot be granted by the court.89\\nXVII SETTLEMENT  BETWEEN P ARTIES\\nIn Murali v. State,90 the Supreme Court while considering an appeal filed by an\\naccused who had been convicted for the of fences punishable under sections 324 and\\n341 IPC reduced his sentence to the period already under gone. Though the of fences\\nwere non-compoundable in nature and in spite of concurrent findings of three preceding\\nforums, the Court considered the case to be a fit one to take a sympathetic view . That\\nthe parties to the dispute have buried their hatchet; that the convicts were young\\ncollege students at the time of commission of the of fence; that there was no previous\\nenmity between the parties; that the convicts had no previous criminal antecedents;\\nthat they were the sole bread earners of their families and had significant social\\n86 (2021) 2 SCC 598.\\n87 (2019) 2 SCC 703.\\n88 (2021) 3 SCC 529.\\n89 In the instant case the police of ficers were prosecuted, inter alia, for the of fence punishable\\nunder section 324 IPC. At the time of commission of the of fence, section 324 was an of fence\\nwhich could be compounded with the permission of the court.

Glanville Williams has given a working definition, without\\nalluding to the subject matter of crime, and has said that “a crime is an act capable of\\nbeing followed by criminal proceedings having a criminal outcome”1 Criminal outcome\\ninvolves stigmatization and possible sentence in the form of punishment. Punishment\\nis considered a legitimate exercise of state power but this power will have to be reigned\\nin lest it becomes an unruly horse. Hence, various procedural protections are guaranteed\\nto the accused and one most important is the presumption of innocence. The\\nproceedings in India are conducted through an adversarial system wherein ordinarily\\nthe burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the char ges leveled against the\\naccused. The presumption of innocence gives a direction to of ficials involved in the\\ncriminal justice process how to deal with the accused. The presumption has no bearing\\non the actual outcome of the case. The substantive and the procedural law complement\\neach other . While substantive criminal law (the Indian Penal Code, 1860) sets out the\\nconduct rules which direct the public to refrain from specified misconduct, the\\nprocedural rules (Criminal Procedure Code, 1973) direct of ficials to investigate and\\nthen prosecute.2 The investigation and prosecution is governed by rules of evidence\\nand circumscribed by the part III of the Constitution. The courts as seats of justice are\\nexpected to sift through the evidence and come to a conclusion of guilt or innocence.\\n The hierarchy of courts is established in order to do complete justice by arriving\\nat the truth. Since courts are manned by human beings (who may inadvertently err),\\nappellate courts are established so that in appeal the evidence and application of laws\\nare further scrutinized  with a singular aim  that the ‘truth’  emer ges and the guilty get\\npunished. It may be axiomatic to mention that the first interface that the public has\\nwith justice delivery mechanism is through the district courts. They are the foundation\\nand pillars on which our justice delivery system is resting and thriving on.

Since courts\\nare expected to give just decisions, appeal mechanisms are integrated in the system to\\nminimize errors. Hence it becomes a cause of concern when appellate courts, while\\ndeciding appeals, pass disparaging remarks on the district judiciary over whom they\\nhave superintendence power only on the administrative side not on the judicial. In a\\ncase the district judiciary had acquitted the accused of a murder char ge. The state\\nwent in appeal and the high court, while reversing the order passed derogatory remarks\\non the trial court verdict which had the potential to seriously undermine its\\nindependence. The apex court while upholding the trial court verdict deprecated the\\npractice of adverse remarks on the trial court verdict and cautioned the high court\\nthus: 3\\nEvery case has its journey towards the truth and it is the Court’ s role to\\nundertake. Truth has to be found on the basis of evidence available\\nbefore it. There is no room for subjectivity nor the nature of the of fence\\naffects its performance. We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with\\ncases. An appellate court shall not expect the trial court to act in a\\nparticular way depending upon the sensitivity of the case. Rather it\\nshould be appreciated if a trial court decides the case on its own merit\\ndespite the sensitivity .\\nThis case needs to be in the course manual of the National Judicial Academy so\\nthat the appellate judiciary does not cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ while sitting in\\nappeal.\\nIt is with these prefatory remarks that the present survey deals with IPC related\\noffences which were decided by the apex court in the year 2021.\\nII OFFENCES AGAINST  HUMAN BODY\\nCulpable homicide\\nMurder is a result crime and issues of causation are very relevant. Additionally ,\\nMacaulay had always advocated for a subjective liability . Hence, for a murder\\nconviction, both these issues become very relevant. In a homicide case the facts were\\nthat, after an altercation over money , the accused pushed the other person and stood\\nover his abdomen causing injuries. The injured was not taken to the hospital till about\\nthe next day and he died there three days later due to septicemia. If one were to apply\\nthe ‘but for ’ test of causation, the septicemia was a result of the injuries but here one\\nalso has to apply the ‘substantial factor ’ test to gauge the causation issues.

In the words of the court:10\\n All the essential elements show that the appellant did not have any\\nprevious quarrel with the deceased; there was lack of animus . The act\\nresulting in SI Tiwari’ s death was not premeditated. Though it cannot\\nbe said that there was a quarrel, caused by sudden provocation, if one\\nconsiders that the deceased tried to board the truck, and was perhaps\\nin plain clothes, the instinctive reaction of the appellant was to resist;\\nhe disproportionately reacted, which resulted in the deceased being\\nthrown of f the vehicle. Such act of throwing of f the deceased and\\ndriving on without pausing, appears to have been in the heat of passion,\\nor rage. Therefore, it is held that the appellant’ s conviction under Section\\n302 IPC was not appropriate.\\nHowever , in the very next paragraph the conviction is under section 304 part I\\nas the court opined that “he had the intention of causing such bodily harm, to the\\ndeceased as was likely to result in his death, as it did”.11 It is submitted that if he just\\nwanted to get him of f the truck it would well be a case of knowledge and not intention!\\nThe initial ar guments do not match up with the ultimate conviction.\\nIn a case the prosecution was able to establish that the husband poured kerosene\\nover his wife and set her on fire as per her dying declaration.

The court held that “it is\\nclear that the use of weapon to constitute the of fence under Section 397 IPC does not\\nrequire that the of fender should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a\\nknife or dagger but the mere exhibition of the same. … create fear or apprehension in\\nthe mind of the victim is suf ficient.”19 It is the of fender alone who ‘uses’  the deadly\\nweapon who would be guilty under section 397 and no constructive liability can be\\nimputed under it.\\nSimple hurt\\nEven cases involving simple hurt entailing six months simple imprisonment\\nare contested up to the apex court!

The law has failed\\nits children and the courts are not doing any better . The law leaves no scope for the so\\ncalled Romeo-Juliet cases and is out to treat consenting partners – the boy as an\\naccused – and the girl as the victim. In 2015 in a love af fair case in State v. Suman\\nDass,24 the contention of the Delhi Commission for Women was that there shall be\\ntotal prohibition upon teenagers and adolescents from having any kind of sexual\\nrelationship! To this the learned district judge had responded thus: “I am afraid, if\\nthat interpretation is allowed, it would mean that the human body of every individual\\nunder 18 years of age is the property of the S tate and no individual below 18 years of\\nage can be allowed to have the pleasures associated with one’ s body”25 It is humbly\\nsubmitted that this fear has come true in the Aversinh’ s case. The girl having owned\\nup the love af fair - “The prosecutrix nevertheless admitted during cross-examination\\nto being in love with the appellant, having had consensual sexual intercourse with\\nhim on a prior date and also having met him outside her home on previous occasions”,26\\nwas then under the control of the patriarchal family and she changed her stance. In a\\nvery problematic way the high court distinguished this case from that of S.\\nVaradarajan27 saying that in that case it was voluntary abandonment:28\\n[T]he High Court has acknowledged that there was a love af fair,\\nfrequent meetings, and consensual relationship between the parties,\\nwhich merited the appellant’ s acquittal under Section 376 IPC. But in\\nthe very same breath, the High Court has also held [ Anvarsinh  v. State\\nof Gujarat , 2009 SCC OnLine Guj 6145] that the prosecutrix did not\\nwillingly leave her parents’ custody and had not consented to be taken\\nfor marriage. These two findings were canvassed as being mutually\\ncontradictory .\\nThe moot question is, did the court come down from its high pedestal to enquire\\nfrom the girl whether she was enticed or she voluntarily abandoned the care of her\\nguardian? The court in its magnanimity reduced the sentence to the period already\\nunder gone, but what about the stigma of criminality which got attached to the boy in\\na consensual love af fair?

The court iterated in Satbir Singh  v. State of Har yana29\\nthat the phrase “soon before” as appearing in section 304B IPC is not “immediately\\nbefore” but it is enough that the prosecution establishes the existence of “proximate\\nand close link” between the dowry death and cruelty!30 The court also raised a concern\\nregarding recording of statements under section 313 Cr PC in a casual manner by the\\ntrial courts thereby denying the very purpose of this important provision which enables\\nthe accused to of fer an explanation for the incriminatory materials appearing against\\nhim. The same view was reiterated in another dowry death case in Gurmeet Singh  v.\\nState of Punjab .31\\nIn a case where the woman went missing from the matrimonial home and there\\nwere dowry allegations also and the body was recovered from the banks of the river ,\\na presumption was raised against the husband under section 1 13B of the Evidence\\nAct.

So far as Section 7 of the POCSO  Act is concerned, the first part\\nthereof exhausts a class of act of sexual assault using specific words,\\nand the other part uses the general act beyond the class denoted by the\\nspecific words. In other words, whoever , with sexual intent touches\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person,\\nwould be committing an of fence of “sexual assault”. Similarly , whoever\\ndoes any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact\\nwithout penetration, would also be committing the of fence of “sexual\\nassault” under Section 7 of the POCSO  Act. In view of the discussion\\nmade earlier , the prosecution was not required to prove a “skin-to-\\nskin” contact for the purpose of proving the char ge of sexual assault\\nunder Section 7 of the Act.\\nRavindra Bhat J., gave a concurring judgment deftly engaging with the embedded\\npatriarchal notions in IPC of fences like outraging the modesty of a woman. The\\nmandatory minimum was sought to be justified in the judgment given the severity of\\nthe crime and the status of a vulnerable child victim. The court held the accused liable\\nfor sexual assault under section 7 of the POCSO Act punishable under section 8 of\\nthe same and other provisions of the IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment\\nfor three years. However , the judges having taken the dif ficult path of questioning the\\npatriarchy could have also dealt with the problematic aspects of the legislation wherein\\nthe consensual cases also fall in the crime category as the definition of child varies\\nfrom 0-18! And the rigour of the POCSO Act does away with the presumption of\\ninnocence giving way to statutory presumption under section 29 of the POCSO Act.\\nThe Act mandates that the accused has to dischar ge this presumption beyond reasonable\\ndoubt. And this has to be accomplished factoring in a very important provision\\ncontained in section 33(6) of the Act which prohibits aggressive questioning or\\ncharacter assassination of a child. This is indeed necessary so that the victim child is\\nguarded against further victimization.  But when looked from the perspective of a\\nframed accused this also becomes a serious issue as he has to put up a spirited defence.\\nAnd, to top it all, the sentencing discretion has been done away with by incorporating\\nmandatory minimum in the Act.

State of A.P37 is akin to reading a research\\npaper on intersectionality of violence, gender , caste and disability . The judgment by\\nChandrached J is divided into topics and sub topics (a pattern that the judge has been\\nfollowing) to make it more reader friendly . The judgment unpacks gender , caste and\\ndisability and intersectionality very eloquently in a case of rape of a visually challenged\\ngirl belonging to the SC community . The court made a very apt observation:38\\n Intersectionality merely ur ges us to have “an open-textured legal\\napproach that would examine underlying structures of inequality”. This\\nrequires us to analyse law in its social and economic context allowing\\nus to formulate questions of equality as that of “power and\\npowerlessness” instead of dif ference and sameness. The latter being a\\nconceptual limitation of single axis analysis, it may allow certain\\nintersectional claims to fall through the cracks since such claims are\\nnot unidirectional in nature.\\nFurther , engaging with disability the court remarked:39\\nThis kind of a judicial attitude stems from and perpetuates the\\nunderlying bias and stereotypes against persons with disabilities. We\\nare of the view that the testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability , or\\nof a disabled witness for that matter , cannot be considered weak or\\ninferior , only because such an individual interacts with the world in a\\ndifferent manner , vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. As long as\\nthe testimony of such a witness otherwise meets the criteria for inspiring\\njudicial confidence, it is entitled to full legal weight. It goes without\\nsaying that the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive\\nto the fact that the witness’ disability can have the consequence of the\\ntestimony being rendered in a dif ferent form, relative to that of an\\nable-bodied witness. In the case at hand, for instance, PW2’ s blindness\\nmeant that she had no visual contact with the world.

The court in Indrapal Singh  v. State of U.P .41\\nreiterated that “in absence of a common intention even if several persons simultaneously\\nattack the man each one of them would be individually liable for whatever injury he\\ncaused and none would be vicariously convicted for the act of any or the other”.42 The\\nprosecution does not have to prove that there was an elaborate plan between the\\naccused to kill the deceased or a plan was in existence for a long time. A common\\nintention to commit the crime is proved if the accused by their words or action indicate\\ntheir assent to join in the commission of crime.43\\nRavinder Bhat J in Netaji Achyut Shinde (Patil)  v. State44  explained the concept\\nof constructive liability very succinctly by saying that when the physical presence of\\nthe two accused was established and evidence was led by way of independent witnesses\\nthat they facilitated the crime that clearly shows that there was a “consensus of the\\nmind of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular act”.45\\nCommon object\\nIn India caste dynamics run unabated in spite of progress in other fronts.

This\\ninfuriated the Jat community and they ordered that the boy and another boy who\\naccompanied the couple be hung upside down and their private parts be burned. This\\nwas not the end of the macabre show . These two boys along with the girl were ordered\\nto be hanged to death and they were taken to a ‘Banyan Tree’, and the parents of the\\nthree youngsters were forced to pull the rope to strangulate them! 35 people were\\nconvicted by the trial court and in appeal the high court acquitted two persons.

If an unlawful assembly is formed with\\nthe common object of committing an of fence, and if that of fence is\\ncommitted in prosecution of the object by any member of the unlawful\\nassembly , all the members of the assembly will be vicariously liable\\nfor that of fence even if one or more, but not all committed the of fence.\\nAgain, if an of fence is committed by a member of an unlawful assembly\\nand that of fence is one which the members of the unlawful assembly\\nknew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object,\\nevery member who had that knowledge will be guilty of the of fence so\\ncommitted. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove each of the\\nmembers’ involvement especially regarding which or what act ( Masalti\\nsupra). While overt act and active participation may indicate common\\nintention of the person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the\\nunlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminal liability under\\nSection 149 .\\nV INCHOA TE OFFENCES\\nAttempt\\nThe line between preparation and attempt is very thin. However , a careful analysis\\ndoes lay the distinction bare. In a case a minor girl was lured into a room and the\\naccused rubbed his genitals against the child and the child started crying. It was a\\nclear case of attempt to rape and the apex court rightly called the high court order\\ncalling the act as preparation to rape  as ‘perverse and untenable’ and convicted the\\naccused under section 376 read with section  51 1 IPC in State of M.P  v. Mahendra .48\\nAbetment\\nOne of the duties of the school and the teachers also is to discipline children\\nand inculcate good habits in them and this may require some kind of reprimand. In\\nthis case a child was reprimanded by a teacher for repeatedly bunking classes and his\\nparents were called. The child committed suicide that night and was found hanging at\\n4 a.m. The physical training instructor was char ged and convicted by the high court\\nfor abetment of suicide.

A reading of the same also suggests\\nthe hyper -sensitive temperament of the deceased which led him to take\\nsuch an extraordinary step, as the alleged reprimand by the accused,\\nwho was his teacher , otherwise would not ordinarily induce a similarly\\ncircumstanced student to commit suicide.\\nSection 1 13A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 raises a presumption of suicide\\nbeing abetted by husband or such relative if the essential ingredients or the of fence\\nare stand satisfied. In a case where the woman committed suicide within two years of\\nmarriage and the of fence of cruelty stood proved the court presumed that it was a case\\nof abetment. The presumption can be rebutted and since no material was brought on\\nrecord to disprove this presumption the high court conviction under sections 498A\\nand 306 IPC was upheld in Gurmansinh  v.

The fact that 28 years had elapsed and the families\\nwere now on cordial terms did not move the court to give any benefit of the alleged\\ncompromise! The victim was leading his life with a prosthetic arm and leg as a result\\nof the assault which made him permanently disabled.\\nThere has been a trend that in some of the cases the courts factor in the possibility\\nof future crimes while deciding the quantum of sentence. In a case of rape the court in\\nManoj Mishra  v. State of U.P59 gave seven years imprisonment (as one it was a pre\\n2018 case so minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years was not attracted) The discretion\\nwas to give the sentence ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. The court\\nobserved “taking into consideration all facts including that no material is available on\\nrecord to indicate that the appellant has any criminal antecedents and that he is also a\\nfather of five children ….., it appears that there is no reason to apprehend that the\\nappellant would indulge in similar acts in future”? 60.\\nIf consensual sex was the consideration, the court did not mention that.   Since\\nthe girl was minor , it was a case of statutory rape. Therefore, the reasoning of the\\ncourt begs a question that why then in certain cases stricter punishments are awarded\\nkeeping the deterrence theory in mind – that it will deter others? It would be very\\nhumane if the judges were to examine this aspect in each case whether the accused\\nhas a proclivity for further crimes.\\nIn a case where the right of private defense was exceeded the court took note of\\nthe fact that the complainants’ family members were the aggressors and they had tried\\nto disturb the peaceful possession of the accused from the land. The court upheld the\\nconviction under section 304 part II, reduced the quantum of sentence to two years\\nrigorous imprisonment and Rs. 5000 /-fine.61\\nReview petition\\nA review petition was filed in Mofil Khan  v. State of Jharkhand 62 wherein it\\ngot listed to be heard in the  open court since death penalty was awarded to the\\npetitioners by the trial court which was upheld by the high court. The court made it\\nclear that the only jurisdiction in a review petition is to see if there has been a patent\\nmistake or glaring omission due to judicial fallibility . The court did not find any such\\nreason to interfere in the instant case. However , the court took note of the fact that\\nthere is a possibility of reformation and rehabilitation.

However , the reasoning of the court was\\nproblematic inasmuch as it based its decision of invoking the Probation of Of fenders\\nAct,1958 on a reasoning that the victim had for given them (that also possibly with\\npassage of time).

State of M.P ,67 three members – one sibling and two nephews\\n– were hacked to death by the appellant over a property dispute. The court on appeal,\\nwhile upholding the conviction, entered into a discussion on reform potentiality of\\nthe accused and opined that since it was the first of fence and the jail superintendant\\ncertificate showed that his conduct was satisfactory in the prison - the death penalty\\nwas commuted to life imprisonment for a period of 30 years. Given the past trends\\nthis meant life imprisonment with no remission for 30 years.\\nReformation\\nIn a 498A IPC case where the husband showed remorse and was willing to\\nmake arrangements for the second wife and his two children born out of this union,\\nthe court pontificated on the object of criminal jurisprudence that “object of any\\ncriminal jurisprudence is reformative in character and to take care of the victim”. The\\nsurveyor is assuming that the victim wife was agreeable to such an arrangement! In\\nfact, the husband should have been asked by the court to do this as part of his liability\\nnot as compensation and punishment for the of fence.

The Supreme Court was completely\\nshocked by the apathy of the trial court and remarked “It is really surprising, as to\\nhow the Additional Sessions Judge could have dealt with the present case in such a\\ncasual manner when he was considering the question of life and death of four\\naccused”.72 The high court, being the superior court, with more experience, maturity\\nand wisdom was equally apathetic as is reflected in the apex court’ s observation:73\\nWe are amazed by the manner in which the High court has dealt with\\nthe present matter .

Chandarsekharan Pillai*\\nI INTRODUCTION\\nTHE CRIMINAL justice system in India has been functioning under the various\\nprovisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr PC) Indian Evidence Act, 1972\\netc. The Indian judiciary af fords protection to the citizens in accordance with the law;\\nwhile implementing the law , the judiciary meticulously enforces the Constitution\\naffording legal protection to the citizens. In this process naturally the highest judiciary\\nincluding the Supreme Court lay down the law for future guidance. The ef forts to\\nachieve clarity of procedure and practices relating to various aspects such as\\ninvestigation, prosecution, trial, bail, evidence, judgement the Supreme Court issued\\nseveral directions to be adopted by the high courts and trial courts in the country . The\\nmove initiated in 2017 thus brought out the necessary changes in procedures and\\npractices.1 In 2021 also the Indian judiciary produced case law in this field. These are\\nanalysed here under dif ferent heads for facility of examination and studies.\\nII FIRST  INFORMA TION REPOR T\\nIt is incumbent upon the courts to preserve the delicate balance between the\\npower to investigate of fences under the Cr PC, and the fundamental rights of the\\nindividual to be free from frivolous and repetitive criminal prosecutions forced upon\\nhim by the might of the S tate.The Supreme Court has, in the past, consistently taken\\nthe position that a second FIR in respect of an of fence or dif ferent of fences committed\\nin the course of the same transaction is not permissible and amounts to a violation of\\narticle 21 of the Constitution of India. This position was reiterated by the Supreme\\nCourt in Krishna Lal Chawla v. State of U.P .2\\nIn Lalita Kumari  v. State of U.P .3 the Supreme Court had held that the police are\\nduty-bound to register an FIR on receipt of information disclosing a cognizable of fence.\\n* B.Sc. (Ker .) LL.B., LL.M. (Del) LL.M.

State of Maharashtra.4 While answering the question in the af firmative,\\nthe Court observed that as to what type and in which cases the preliminary enquiry is\\nto be conducted will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\nIII INVESTIGA TION\\nIn Laxmibai Chandaragi B. v. State of Karnataka,5 the Supreme Court criticised\\nthe investigating of ficer for his failure to close a man missing case instituted on\\ninformation given by parent of a girl after the girl who went missing informed him\\nthat she had married another man. The court took exception to the conduct of the\\ninvestigating of ficer in insisting the girl to report at the police station for recording\\nher statement. According to the court, consent of the family or the community or the\\nclan is not necessary once two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that\\ntheir consent has to be piously given primacy . The court directed the police authorities\\nto counsel the investigating of ficers, devise training programme to educate investigating\\nofficers and also lay down guidelines on how to deal with such socially sensitive\\ncases.\\nIn Supr eme Bhiwandi W ada Manor Infrastr uctur e (P) Ltd. v. State of\\nMaharashtra,6 the Supreme Court set aside an order of the high court since it was\\nfound to be contrary to line of precedents7 dealing with the distinction in the power of\\nthe magistrate under section 156 (3) Cr PC and section 202 Cr PC. According to the\\nCourt the power of the Magistrate under section 156 (3) CrPC. to order investigation\\nby the police is not touched or af fected by section 202 Cr PC. The investigation\\nwhich the magistrate can direct under section 202(1) either by a police of ficer or by\\nany other person is for a limited purpose of enabling the magistrate to decide whether\\nor not there is suf ficient ground to proceed further . The power under Section 156(3)\\ncan be exercised by the magistrate even before he takes cognizance provided the\\ncomplaint discloses the commission of cognizable of fence.\\nIn Sidhar th v. State of U. P .8 the Supreme Court had occasion to criticise the\\napproach of trial courts in insisting on the arrest of the accused as a prerequisite\\nformality to take a char gesheet on record.9 According to the Supreme Court, section\\n170 Cr PC does not impose an obligation on the of ficer-in-char ge to arrest each and\\nevery accused at the time of filing of the char ge-sheet. If the investigating of ficer\\ndoes not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons he/she is not\\nrequired to be produced in custody .

The court also pointed out the distinction\\nbetween the existence of power to arrest and justification for exercise of that power .\\nIt observed:10\\n……….  personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional\\nmandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises\\nwhen custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime\\nor where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused\\nmay abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful\\ndoes not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made\\nbetween the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for\\nexercise of it. If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm\\nto the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the investigating of ficer\\nhas no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey\\nsummons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation\\nwe fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the of ficer\\nto arrest the accused.\\nIn Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay Sharma,11the Supreme Court reiterated the procedure\\nto be followed when there is a complaint and police investigation in respect of the\\nsame of fence. According to the court there is no bar to lodge an FIR when a complaint\\nhas been filed earlier on the same set of facts with the same set of allegations and\\naverments.\\nThe Supreme Court and high courts are ‘sentinels of justice’ that ensure that\\nrule of law and constitutional guarantees of a fair and impartial investigation are\\nupheld. While investigating of fences justice must not only be done but also be seen\\nand perceived to be done. In the past the Supreme Court has made creative interventions\\nto ensure fairness in investigations by taking steps for monitoring investigations by\\npolice on a daily basis. Such an intervention was made by the Supreme Court during\\nthe period covered by this survey . The Supreme Court was seized of the In re Violence\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh) Leading to Loss of Life12 matter when two lawyers\\nwrote to the court seeking an independent inquiry into an incident in which several\\npeople who were protesting against the Agricultural Acts of 2020 were rammed from\\nbehind and run over by a vehicle resulting in eight deaths and injury to several others.\\nEver since then, the case was investigated by a Special Investigation Team which\\nessentially comprised of middle level/subordinate level of ficers of U.P . police posted\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri district. When the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court on\\nvarious occasions some of the parties questioned the fairness of the investigation\\nconducted by the SIT .

State of M.P .14, the Supreme Court modified an order passed\\nby the Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court whereby the high court had\\ngranted anticipatory bail to an accused subject to the condition of deposit of Rs 41\\nlakhs in court and upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 with\\none solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting of ficer. While\\nissuing the said order the high court had further directed that the order would be\\ngoverned by conditions 1 to 3 of sub-section (2) of section 438 of the Cr PC. The trial\\ncourt was also directed to deposit the amount so deposited by the appellant with any\\nnationalised bank.The Supreme Court expressed the view that by imposing the\\ncondition of deposit of Rs 41 lakhs, the high court has, in an application for pre-arrest\\nbail under section 438 of the Cr PC, virtually issued directions in the nature of recovery\\nin a civil suit. The court clarified:15\\nIt is well settled by a plethora of decisions of this Court that criminal\\nproceedings are not for realisation of disputed dues. It is open to a\\ncourt to grant or refuse the prayer for anticipatory bail, depending on\\nthe facts and circumstances of the particular case. The factors to be\\ntaken into consideration, while considering an application for bail are\\nthe nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case\\nof conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the\\nprosecution; reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses\\nor apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; reasonable\\npossibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial\\nor the likelihood of his abscondence; character , behaviour and standing\\nof the accused; and the circumstances which are peculiar or the accused\\nand lar ger interest of the public or the S tate and similar other\\nconsiderations. A criminal court, exercising jurisdiction to grant bail/\\nanticipatory bail, is not expected to act as a recovery agent to realise\\nthe dues of the complainant, and that too, without any trial.\\nWith a view to avoid unnecessary bail matters reaching the court, the Supreme\\nCourt in Satender Kumar Antil v.

The court\\nexpressed the view that the order granting anticipatory bail suf fered from serious\\ninfirmities resulting in miscarriage of justice.\\nNon-compliance with the procedure contained in section 41 CrPC before\\narresting an accused, as adumbrated in the judgment in Arnesh Kumar  v. State of\\nBihar ,21 was taken as a factor for releasing him on interim bail.22\\nIn Union of India v . K.A. Najeeb,23 the Supreme Court emphasised on the need\\nfor harmonising the restrictions in the matter of grant of bail imposed by a statute as\\nwell as the powers exercisable under constitutional jurisdiction. According to the\\nCourt, statutory restrictions like Section 43-D(5) of the UAP A per se does not oust\\nthe power of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part III\\nof the Constitution. At commencement of proceedings, the courts are expected to\\nappreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions\\nwill melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable\\ntime and the period of incarceration already under gone has exceeded a substantial\\npart of the prescribed sentence.\\nReasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision-\\nmaking process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial\\nand even by administrative bodies.Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised\\nby the decision-maker on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous\\nconsiderations.Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability\\nand transparency . Time and again the Supreme Court has emphasised the need for\\nassigning reasons while issuing an order granting bail to an accused. In Brijmani\\nDevi v. Pappu Kumar ,24 the Supreme Court set aside a cryptic order by which the high\\ncourt granted bail to an accused and held that though elaborate reasons need not be\\n18 (2021) 10 SCC 773.\\n19 2020) 5 SCC 1.\\n20 (2021) 8 SCC 753.\\n21 (2014) 8 SCC 273.\\n22 Munawar v.

Pankaj Jagshi Gangar ,27the Supreme Court deprecated\\nthe tendency of certain accused to go for forum-shopping in the matter of bail. In this\\ncase a person accused of of fences under MCOCA  filed an appeal before a single\\njudge of high court against the order of a special judge. While the bail application\\nwas pending before the single judge, the accused sensing that the judge was not inclined\\nto grant bail, withdrew the appeal and thereafter preferred a writ petition before a\\ndivision bench of the high court under the guise of challenging the vires of MCOCA.\\nWithout being aware of what transpired earlier , the division bench released the accused\\non bail and that too by way of interim relief. The Supreme Court referred to this as an\\ninstance of forum shopping and described it as a conduct which cannot be approved.\\nThe order passed by the division bench of the high court was therefore quashed and\\nset aside by the Supreme Court.\\nIn Enfor cement Dir ectorate, Government of India  v.

In Ramesh Bhavan\\nRathod35 the court also expressed its disapproval at the observation of the High Court\\nthat the grant of bail to one accused shall not be considered as a precedent for any\\nother person who is accused in the FIR on grounds of parity .

This order came to be challenged before the Supreme Court through an\\nappeal by special leave. The appellant, relying on the proviso to section 438 Cr PC.,\\nraised the ar gument that the impugned orders, wherein the high court granted protection\\nto the respondents subsequent to the dismissal of their application, was therefore\\npassed in excess of the high court’ s jurisdiction under section 438 Cr PC. While\\nanswering the legal question whether the High Courtwhile dismissing the anticipatory\\nbail applications of the respondentscould have granted them protection from arrest,\\nthe Supreme Court in Nathu Singh v. State of U.P .40 observed:41\\nWe cannot be oblivious to the circumstances that courts are faced with\\nday in and day out, while dealing with anticipatory bail applications.\\nEven when the court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to an\\naccused, there may be circumstances where the High Court is of the\\nopinion that it is necessary to protect the person apprehending arrest\\nfor some time, due to exceptional circumstances, until they surrender\\nbefore the trial court. For example, the applicant may plead protection\\nfor some time as he/she is the primary caregiver or breadwinner of his/\\nher family members, and needs to make arrangements for them. In\\nsuch extraordinary circumstances, when a strict case for grant of\\nanticipatory bail is not made out, and rather the investigating authority\\nhas made out a case for custodial investigation, it cannot be stated that\\nthe High Court has no power to ensure justice.\\nWhile making the above observation, the Supreme Court located the source of\\nthe said power in section 482 Cr PC.

A\\nsignificant factor in this backlog is the vast mass of frivolous litigation instituted year\\nafter year by litigants with an intent to use the courts of justice for their own\\nmischievous ends. Curtailing such vexatious litigation is, thus, a crucial step towards\\na more ef fective justice system—a step that cannot be taken without the active\\ninvolvement of the lower judiciary , especially in criminal proceedings. In Krishna\\nLal Chawla v. State of U.P .43 (2021) 5 SCC 435the Supreme Court highlighted the\\nrole of trial judges in identifying and disposing of frivolous litigation at an early\\nstage. In paragraph 17 of Krishna Lal Chawla44 the court made the following\\nobservation:\\nImmediately after the criminal justice system is set in motion, its course\\nis almost entirely dependent on the judicial application of mind by the\\nMagistrate. When a police complaint is filed on the commission of a\\ncognizable of fence under Section 154 CrPC, the Magistrate decides if\\nthe char ge against the accused person is made out before the trial begins.\\nSeparate procedure is prescribed if the complaint under Section 200\\nCrPC is filed. The aforesaid provisions make it abundantly clear that\\nthe Magistrate carries the stream of criminal proceeding forward after\\nit is set in motion by the informant/complainant. Consequently , and\\nautomatically , the Magistrate also carries the responsibility for ensuring\\nthis stream does not carry forward in cases where it should not\\nThereafter in paragraph 19 the court noted:\\nSimilarly , the power conferred on the Magistrate under Section 202 CrPC to\\npostpone the issue of process pursuant to a private complaint also provides an important\\navenue for filtering out of frivolous complaints that must be fully exercised.\\nIn paragraph 20, the court said:\\nIt is said that every trial is a voyage of discovery in which the truth is\\nthe quest. In India, typically , the Judge is not actively involved in “fact-\\nfinding” owing to the adversarial nature of our justice system. However ,\\nSection 165 of the Evidence Act, 1872 by providing the Judge with the\\npower to order production of material and put forth questions of any\\nform at any time, marks the influence of inquisitorial processes in our\\nlegal system. This wide-ranging power further demonstrates the central\\nrole played by the Magistrate in the quest for justice and truth in criminal\\nproceedings, and must be judiciously employed to stem the flow of\\nfrivolous litigation.\\nThe trial courts, according to the Supreme Court,45 have the power to not merely\\ndecide on acquittal or conviction of the accused person after the trial, but also the\\n43 (2021) 5 SCC 435.\\n44 Krishna Lal Chawla v.

This would not only save judicial time that comes\\nat the cost of public money , but would also protect the right to liberty that every\\nperson is entitled to under Article 21 of the Constitution.\\nVI SANCTION FOR PROSECUTION\\nThe Cr PC treats public servants as a special category in order to protect them\\nfrom malicious or vexatious prosecutions. Section 197 of the Code seeks to protect\\nan of ficer who is accused of an of fence committed while acting or purporting to act in\\nthe dischar ge of his of ficial duties from unnecessary harassment. It prohibits the court\\nfrom taking cognisance of such of fence except with the previous sanction of the\\ncompetent authority . On earlier occasions the Supreme Court has held that section\\n197 Cr PC should be construed in such a manner as to advance the cause of honesty ,\\njustice and good governance.46 In Indra Devi v. State of Rajasthan ,47 the Supreme\\nCourt had an opportunity to summarise the principle to be applied while determining\\nwhether sanction under section 197 Cr PC is required or not. According to the court,\\nsanction under section 197 Cr PC is necessary if the of fence alleged against the public\\nservant is committed by him “while acting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his\\nofficial duty” and in order to find out whether the alleged of fence is committed “while\\nacting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his of ficial duty”, the yardstick to be\\nfollowed is to form a prima facie  view whether the act of omission for which the\\naccused was char ged had a reasonable connection with the dischar ge of his duties.\\nVII WITNESS PROTECTION\\nFor instance, In Re V iolence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) Leading to Loss of Life48\\nthe Supreme Court directed the state government to provide protection to all witnesses\\nconnected with the case as per the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.\\nVIII FRAMING OF CHARGE\\nThe factors to be considered at the time of framing of char ge were reiterated\\nand summarised in State of Rajasthan  v.

Convenience for the purposes of transfer means the convenience\\nof the prosecution, other accused, the witnesses and the lar ger interest of the\\nsociety .Convenience of a party may be one of the relevant considerations but cannot\\noverride all other considerations such as the availability of witnesses exclusively at\\nthe original place, making it virtually impossible to continue with the trial at the place\\nof transfer , and progress of which would naturally be impeded for that reason at the\\n46 Subramanian Swamy v.

State (NCT  of Delhi),50 the Supreme\\nCourt refused to transfer a criminal case from Delhi to Allahabad (Prayagraj) on the\\nground that most of the prosecution witnesses were located at Delhi. According to the\\ncourt, if the transfer petition is allowed, the witnesses would be required to travel\\nfrom Delhi to Allahabad, which in turn would cause hindrance in performing their\\nofficial duties.\\nX EXERCISE OF INHERENT POWERS\\nThe inherent jurisdiction under section 482 Cr PC is designed to achieve the\\nsalutary purpose that criminal proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate\\ninto weapon of harassment. While quashing an FIR in Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay\\nSharma,51the Supreme Court reiterated the settled position that criminal proceedings\\ncan be quashed when the court is satisfied that such proceedings amount to an abuse\\nof process of law or that it amounts to bringing pressure upon the accused. A litigant\\npursuing frivolous and vexatious proceedings cannot claim unlimited right upon court\\ntime and public money to achieve his ends. It has therefore been held that the inherent\\npower can be exercised by the court to deny any relief to a litigant who attempts to\\npollute the stream of justice by coming to it with his unclean hands.52\\nThe question whether an interim order of no coercive steps during proceedings\\nunder section 482 Cr PC and/or under article 226 of the Constitution of India could\\nbe passed by the High Court was addressed by the Supreme Court in two judgments\\npronounced during the period covered by the survey . In Neeharika Infrastr uctur e\\nPrivate Ltd.  v. State of Maharashtra53the Supreme Court frowned upon the tendency\\nof the courts to pass blanket, cryptic, laconic, non-speaking orders reading “ no coer cive\\nsteps shall be adopted ”.However , it allowed space for the high court to pass such\\norders “ in exceptional cases with caution and cir cumspection, giving brief r easons ”.\\nSubsequently in Siddhar thMukesh Bhandari v. State of Gujarat,54 the court while\\nreiterating the position taken in Neeharika Infrastr uctur e55 noted:56\\nAn interim order of stay of investigation during the pendency of the\\nquashing petition can be passed with circumspection. Such an interim\\norder should not require to be passed routinely , casually and/or\\nmechanically . Normally , when the investigation is in progress and the\\nfacts are hazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High\\nCourt, the High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim\\norder of not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” and the\\naccused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under Section\\n438CrPC before the competent court.

A retrial should be limited to the extreme exigency to avert a “failure\\nof justice”. In Nasib Singh ,61 the court also had the occasion to summarise the principles\\nthat emer ge from the various judicial pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the\\nmatter of ordering retrials. The principles are enumerated below:62\\ni.The appellate court may direct a retrial only in “exceptional” circumstances\\nto avert a miscarriage of justice.\\nii.Mere lapses in the investigation are not suf ficient to warrant a direction\\nfor retrial. Only if the lapses are so grave so as to prejudice the rights of\\nthe parties, can a retrial be directed.\\niii.A determination of whether a “shoddy” investigation/trial has prejudiced\\nthe party , must be based on the facts of each case pursuant to a thorough\\nreading of the evidence.\\niv.It is not suf ficient if the accused/prosecution makes a facial ar gument that\\nthere has been a miscarriage of justice warranting a retrial. It is incumbent\\non the appellate court directing a retrial to provide a reasoned order on the\\nnature of the miscarriage of justice caused with reference to the evidence\\nand investigatory process.\\nThe aim of every court is to discover the truth. Section 31 1 Cr PC is one of the\\nprovisions which strengthen the arms of a court in its ef fort to unearth the truth by\\nprocedure sanctioned by law . In V. N. Patil  v. K. Niranjan Kumar63 the Supreme Court\\nwhile summarising the principles relating to object and scope of section 31 1 Cr PC\\nheld that the discretionary power vested in the courts has to be exercised judiciously\\nfor strong and valid reasons and with caution and circumspection to meet the ends of\\njustice.\\nXI POWER TO PROCEED AGAINST  OTHER PERSONS\\nThe position regarding the exercise of power under section 319 Cr PC i.e.,\\npower to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of of fence was clarified\\nby a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court as early as in 2014.64 In Ramesh Chandra\\nSrivastava v. State of U.P .65 a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court reiterated the\\nposition as laid down in Hardeep Singh66 and held that the power under section 319\\nCr PC should be exercised only when strong and cogent evidence occurs against a\\nperson from the evidence. In the instant case the Sessions Judge had exercised the\\npower under section 319 Cr PC in a casual and cavalier manner . The order of the\\nsessions judge was unsuccessfully challenged before the High Court.

State of Uttarakhand,69 the Supreme Court further reminded\\nthat the power under section 319 Cr PC is a discretionary and extraordinary power\\nwhich is to be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of\\nthe case so warrant.\\nXII APPEALS\\nWhile considering an appeal against conviction, the Supreme Court, in Samaul\\nS. K.  v. State of Jharkhand,70used the voluntary initiative of the accused to pay an\\namount of Rs. 3 lakhs for the benefit of the victim and her children as a ground to\\nreduce the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment for an of fence under section\\n498A to seven months imprisonment which was the period of incarceration already\\nunder gone by him on the date of the order .\\nThe scope of the power of a court considering an appeal against acquittal was\\nclarified further in Jayamma v. State of Karnataka.71 According to the Supreme Court,\\nunless the high court finds that there is complete misreading of the material evidence\\nwhich has led to miscarriage of justice, the view taken by the trial court which can\\nalso possibly be a correct view , need not be interfered with. This self-restraint doctrine,\\nof course, does not denude the high court of its powers to reappreciate the evidence,\\nincluding in an appeal against acquittal and arrive at a dif ferentfinding of fact.\\nWhile discussing the scope of the powers of an appellate court dealing with an\\nappeal against acquittal, the Supreme Court in Achhar Singh v. State of H.P .72 held\\nthat though it is a well-crystallised principle that if two views are possible, the High\\nCourt ought not to interfere with the trial court’ s judgment, such a precautionary\\nprinciple cannot be overstretched to portray that the “ contours of appeal ” against\\nacquittal under Section 378 Cr PC are limited to seeing whether or not the trial court’ s\\nview was impos sible.\\n67 Hardeep Singh  v.

State of Punjab,73 the Supreme Court had identified the\\nanti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime as one of the factors that may be\\ntaken into account by the court for imposition of death sentence. In Hari  v. State of\\nUttar Pradesh74decided during the period covered by the survey the Court held that\\nthe ghastly murders of three youngsters which are honour killings squarely falls under\\nthe head of anti-social and abhorrent nature of the crime as mentioned in Machi Singh .75\\nIn Bhagchandra  v. State of Madhya Pradesh76Supreme Court converted the\\ndeath sentence awarded to a convict who murdered two of his siblings and one nephew\\nto life imprisonment for a period of two years. The court noted:77\\nIn view of the settled legal position, it is our bounden duty to take into\\nconsideration the probability of the accused being reformed and\\nrehabilitated. It is also our duty to take into consideration not only the\\ncrime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio-economic\\nconditions. The deceased as well as the appellant are rustic villagers.\\nIn a property dispute, the appellant has got done away with two of his\\nsiblings and a nephew . The S tate has not placed on record any evidence\\nto show that there is no possibility with respect to reformation or\\nrehabilitation of the convict. …………………………………………\\nThe appellant comes from a rural and economically poor background.\\nThere are no criminal antecedents. The appellant cannot be said to be\\na hardened criminal. This is the first of fence committed by the appellant,\\nno doubt, a heinous one. The certificate issued by the Jail Superintendent\\nshows that the conduct of the appellant during incarceration has been\\nsatisfactory . It cannot therefore be said that there is no possibility of\\nthe appellant being reformed and rehabilitated foreclosing the\\nalternative option of a lesser sentence and making imposition of death\\nsentence imperative.\\nIn another case78 the court commuted the death sentence awarded to a convict\\nfor the of fence punishable under section 302 IPC to one of life imprisonment on the\\nfollowing grounds:79\\nThe appellant is a young person, who was 23 years old at the time of\\ncommission of the of fence. He comes from a rural background. The\\nState has not placed any evidence to show that there is no possibility\\nwith respect to reformation and the rehabilitation of the accused.

The conduct of the appellant in the prison has\\nbeen found to be satisfactory . There are no criminal antecedents. It is\\nthe first of fence committed by the appellant. No doubt, a heinous one.\\nThe appellant is not a hardened criminal. It therefore cannot be said\\nthat there is no possibility of the appellant being reformed and\\nrehabilitated foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and\\nmaking imposition of death sentence imperative.\\nOn earlier occasions, through decisions such as Muthuramalingam,80 O. M.\\nCherian81 and Nagaraja Rao82the Supreme Court has clarified that while awarding\\nmultiple sentences a court of first instance is under a legal obligation to specify in\\nclear terms as to whether they would run concurrently or consecutively and that\\nsentences awarded by a court for several of fences committed by a convict shall run\\nconsecutively unless otherwise directed by the court. In Sunil Kumar v . State of U.P .83the\\nSupreme Court came across a situation where not only the trial court but also the\\nHigh Court omitted to specify whether the sentences awarded to the convicts shall\\nrun concurrently or consecutively . Though it observed that the omissions will not, by\\nthemselves, provide a room for concurrent running of sentences, the Court keeping in\\nview the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case invoked its power under Article\\n142 so as to modify the punishment awarded to the convicts in the manner that the\\nmaximum period of imprisonment to be served by them in relation to of fences in\\nquestion shall be 14 years and not beyond.\\nXIV REMISSION OF SENTENCES\\nIn State of Har yana v. Raj Kumar ,84 the Supreme Court had an opportunity to\\naddress the nature and scope of power of the Governor under article 161 of Constitution\\nof India and the manner in which the said power was to be exercised. Holding that the\\nrestrictions under section 433-A cannot apply to the constitutional power under article\\n161 of the Constitution of India, the court observed:85\\n[t]he power of the appropriate Government to release a prisoner after\\nserving 14 years of actual imprisonment is vested with the S tate\\nGovernment. On the other hand, the power conferred on the Governor ,\\nthough exercised on the aid and advice of the S tate, is without any\\n80 Muthuramalingam  v. State, (2016) 8 SCC 313.\\n81 O. M.

Such power is in exercise of the power of the\\nsovereign, though the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice\\nof the S tate Government.\\nXV SAFEGAURDING RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME\\nIn X v. State of Jharkhand,86 the Supreme Court after referring to its own\\njudgment in NipunSaxena  v. Union of India,87 reminded the media of its obligation to\\nnot print or publish the name of the rape victims or even in a remote manner disclose\\nany facts which can lead to the suchvictims being identified.\\nXVI COMPOUNDING OF OFFENCES\\nThe mere fact that an of fence is compoundable with consent of the court need\\nnot persuade the court to automatically or mechanically exercise the power of\\ncompounding. Nature of the of fence and its ef fect on society are relevant\\nconsiderations, which the court must consider carefully while determining whether\\nleave to compound of fence is to be granted or not. Thus, in Pravat Chandra Mohanty\\nv. State of Odisha,88 the Supreme Court observed that of fences involving police\\nbrutalities are crimes not only against the victims but also against humanity and hence\\npermission for compounding of such of fences cannot be granted by the court.89\\nXVII SETTLEMENT  BETWEEN P ARTIES\\nIn Murali v. State,90 the Supreme Court while considering an appeal filed by an\\naccused who had been convicted for the of fences punishable under sections 324 and\\n341 IPC reduced his sentence to the period already under gone. Though the of fences\\nwere non-compoundable in nature and in spite of concurrent findings of three preceding\\nforums, the Court considered the case to be a fit one to take a sympathetic view . That\\nthe parties to the dispute have buried their hatchet; that the convicts were young\\ncollege students at the time of commission of the of fence; that there was no previous\\nenmity between the parties; that the convicts had no previous criminal antecedents;\\nthat they were the sole bread earners of their families and had significant social\\n86 (2021) 2 SCC 598.\\n87 (2019) 2 SCC 703.\\n88 (2021) 3 SCC 529.\\n89 In the instant case the police of ficers were prosecuted, inter alia, for the of fence punishable\\nunder section 324 IPC. At the time of commission of the of fence, section 324 was an of fence\\nwhich could be compounded with the permission of the court. However , it may be noted that\\nsection 324 was made non-compoundable by way of an amendment in 2005.\\n90 (2021) 1 SCC 726.', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\009-Criminal Procedure.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

Glanville Williams has given a working definition, without\\nalluding to the subject matter of crime, and has said that “a crime is an act capable of\\nbeing followed by criminal proceedings having a criminal outcome”1 Criminal outcome\\ninvolves stigmatization and possible sentence in the form of punishment. Punishment\\nis considered a legitimate exercise of state power but this power will have to be reigned\\nin lest it becomes an unruly horse. Hence, various procedural protections are guaranteed\\nto the accused and one most important is the presumption of innocence. The\\nproceedings in India are conducted through an adversarial system wherein ordinarily\\nthe burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove the char ges leveled against the\\naccused. The presumption of innocence gives a direction to of ficials involved in the\\ncriminal justice process how to deal with the accused. The presumption has no bearing\\non the actual outcome of the case. The substantive and the procedural law complement\\neach other . While substantive criminal law (the Indian Penal Code, 1860) sets out the\\nconduct rules which direct the public to refrain from specified misconduct, the\\nprocedural rules (Criminal Procedure Code, 1973) direct of ficials to investigate and\\nthen prosecute.2 The investigation and prosecution is governed by rules of evidence\\nand circumscribed by the part III of the Constitution. The courts as seats of justice are\\nexpected to sift through the evidence and come to a conclusion of guilt or innocence.\\n The hierarchy of courts is established in order to do complete justice by arriving\\nat the truth. Since courts are manned by human beings (who may inadvertently err),\\nappellate courts are established so that in appeal the evidence and application of laws\\nare further scrutinized  with a singular aim  that the ‘truth’  emer ges and the guilty get\\npunished. It may be axiomatic to mention that the first interface that the public has\\nwith justice delivery mechanism is through the district courts. They are the foundation\\nand pillars on which our justice delivery system is resting and thriving on.

Since courts\\nare expected to give just decisions, appeal mechanisms are integrated in the system to\\nminimize errors. Hence it becomes a cause of concern when appellate courts, while\\ndeciding appeals, pass disparaging remarks on the district judiciary over whom they\\nhave superintendence power only on the administrative side not on the judicial. In a\\ncase the district judiciary had acquitted the accused of a murder char ge. The state\\nwent in appeal and the high court, while reversing the order passed derogatory remarks\\non the trial court verdict which had the potential to seriously undermine its\\nindependence. The apex court while upholding the trial court verdict deprecated the\\npractice of adverse remarks on the trial court verdict and cautioned the high court\\nthus: 3\\nEvery case has its journey towards the truth and it is the Court’ s role to\\nundertake. Truth has to be found on the basis of evidence available\\nbefore it. There is no room for subjectivity nor the nature of the of fence\\naffects its performance. We have a hierarchy of courts in dealing with\\ncases. An appellate court shall not expect the trial court to act in a\\nparticular way depending upon the sensitivity of the case. Rather it\\nshould be appreciated if a trial court decides the case on its own merit\\ndespite the sensitivity .\\nThis case needs to be in the course manual of the National Judicial Academy so\\nthat the appellate judiciary does not cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha’ while sitting in\\nappeal.\\nIt is with these prefatory remarks that the present survey deals with IPC related\\noffences which were decided by the apex court in the year 2021.\\nII OFFENCES AGAINST  HUMAN BODY\\nCulpable homicide\\nMurder is a result crime and issues of causation are very relevant. Additionally ,\\nMacaulay had always advocated for a subjective liability . Hence, for a murder\\nconviction, both these issues become very relevant. In a homicide case the facts were\\nthat, after an altercation over money , the accused pushed the other person and stood\\nover his abdomen causing injuries. The injured was not taken to the hospital till about\\nthe next day and he died there three days later due to septicemia. If one were to apply\\nthe ‘but for ’ test of causation, the septicemia was a result of the injuries but here one\\nalso has to apply the ‘substantial factor ’ test to gauge the causation issues. It is important\\nto understand that “’ substantial’  involves a question of degree depending on the\\nparticular circumstances of the case and may involve a value addition evaluation.”4 In\\nthe instant case, Khokan  v.

State of Punjab6 where it was held that since it\\nwas a case of sudden fight and the appellant-accused attacked the deceased with a\\nknife – there being no pre-meditation or intention the conviction was altered to section\\n304 part II IPC.7\\nAs far as culpable homicide is concerned merely because the injuries are on\\nnon vital parts of the body does not prove non-intention. The entire factum of the case\\n– the setting, the assault will have to be examined. In Vinod Kumar  v. Amritpal,8  the\\nvictim was forcibly taken in a vehicle and the vehicle was stopped on reaching the\\nunmetalled road. The victim was then taken out of the vehicle and forced on the\\nground and was assaulted. The case clearly fell within the contours of murder under\\nthirdly of section 300 IPC, opined the court.\\nIn Mohd Rafiq  v. State of M.P .9 the apex court engaged in an extensive discussion\\non murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder and the use of the word\\n‘likely’ in section 304. It finally came to the conclusion that conviction under section\\n302 was not warranted. In the words of the court:10\\n All the essential elements show that the appellant did not have any\\nprevious quarrel with the deceased; there was lack of animus . The act\\nresulting in SI Tiwari’ s death was not premeditated. Though it cannot\\nbe said that there was a quarrel, caused by sudden provocation, if one\\nconsiders that the deceased tried to board the truck, and was perhaps\\nin plain clothes, the instinctive reaction of the appellant was to resist;\\nhe disproportionately reacted, which resulted in the deceased being\\nthrown of f the vehicle. Such act of throwing of f the deceased and\\ndriving on without pausing, appears to have been in the heat of passion,\\nor rage. Therefore, it is held that the appellant’ s conviction under Section\\n302 IPC was not appropriate.\\nHowever , in the very next paragraph the conviction is under section 304 part I\\nas the court opined that “he had the intention of causing such bodily harm, to the\\ndeceased as was likely to result in his death, as it did”.11 It is submitted that if he just\\nwanted to get him of f the truck it would well be a case of knowledge and not intention!\\nThe initial ar guments do not match up with the ultimate conviction.\\nIn a case the prosecution was able to establish that the husband poured kerosene\\nover his wife and set her on fire as per her dying declaration.

State of T .N.,13 “Ordinarily when the\\nhusband and wife remained within the four walls of a house and death by suicide\\ntakes place it will be for the husband to explain the circumstance in which she might\\nhave died. However , we cannot lose sight of the fact that although the same may be\\nconsidered to be a strong circumstance but that alone in the absence of any evidence\\nof violence on the deceased cannot be held to be conclusive!”14 The apex court in\\nappeal, taking note of this, held that section 106 Evidence Act and the last seen theory\\ndo not absolve the prosecution of dischar ging its primary duty of proving the\\nprosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. The apex court in Shivaji Chintappa Patil\\nv. State of Maharashtra15 set aside the conviction and reiterated that in the case of\\ncircumstantial evidence motive needs to be proved and the prosecution failed to do so\\non all counts.\\nKidnapping\\nIn a case where a child was kidnapped and a ransom demand was made the high\\ncourt af firmed the conviction under section 364-A  which specifically talks about\\nransom. However , the court engaged in a detailed examination of the said section and\\ncame to the conclusion that kidnapping was there, ransom was demanded but another\\nimportant ingredient was missing i.e., “and threatens to cause death or hurt to such\\nperson”. The facts of SK. Ahmed  v. State of T elangana16 revealed that no such threat\\nwas made and the child was looked after well and hence the conviction under section\\n364-A (IPC) was set aside and the appellant was convicted under section 363 IPC and\\nwas sentenced to seven years imprisonment.\\nDacoity\\nThe state is wary of numbers and so stringent punishments are factored in for\\noffences perpetrated by a lar ger group.

The contention\\nin Ram Ratan  v. State of M.P .18 was that since the appellant had not used the firearm\\neven if it is held that the incident had occurred as alleged. The court held that “it is\\nclear that the use of weapon to constitute the of fence under Section 397 IPC does not\\nrequire that the of fender should actually fire from the firearm or actually stab if it is a\\nknife or dagger but the mere exhibition of the same. … create fear or apprehension in\\nthe mind of the victim is suf ficient.”19 It is the of fender alone who ‘uses’  the deadly\\nweapon who would be guilty under section 397 and no constructive liability can be\\nimputed under it.\\nSimple hurt\\nEven cases involving simple hurt entailing six months simple imprisonment\\nare contested up to the apex court! It is true that personal liberty is sacrosanct and\\nguaranteed under article 21 but it is submitted that some filtering mechanism will\\nhave to be evolved for matters to reach the constitutional court!20 The court’ s dockets\\nare brimming with cases and some mechanism may have to be devised so that the\\napex court has time to deal with serious cases and timely justice becomes the hallmark\\nof the system.\\nIII OFFENCES AGAINST  WOMEN\\nA love af fair culminating in a secret marriage and the girl being minor the parents\\npress for kidnapping char ges!

The love af fair among adolescents is, thus, brought under the\\nambit of ‘enticing’, ignoring the fact that it was mutual love, being equal partners in\\nthe crime!

The law has failed\\nits children and the courts are not doing any better . The law leaves no scope for the so\\ncalled Romeo-Juliet cases and is out to treat consenting partners – the boy as an\\naccused – and the girl as the victim. In 2015 in a love af fair case in State v. Suman\\nDass,24 the contention of the Delhi Commission for Women was that there shall be\\ntotal prohibition upon teenagers and adolescents from having any kind of sexual\\nrelationship! To this the learned district judge had responded thus: “I am afraid, if\\nthat interpretation is allowed, it would mean that the human body of every individual\\nunder 18 years of age is the property of the S tate and no individual below 18 years of\\nage can be allowed to have the pleasures associated with one’ s body”25 It is humbly\\nsubmitted that this fear has come true in the Aversinh’ s case. The girl having owned\\nup the love af fair - “The prosecutrix nevertheless admitted during cross-examination\\nto being in love with the appellant, having had consensual sexual intercourse with\\nhim on a prior date and also having met him outside her home on previous occasions”,26\\nwas then under the control of the patriarchal family and she changed her stance. In a\\nvery problematic way the high court distinguished this case from that of S.\\nVaradarajan27 saying that in that case it was voluntary abandonment:28\\n[T]he High Court has acknowledged that there was a love af fair,\\nfrequent meetings, and consensual relationship between the parties,\\nwhich merited the appellant’ s acquittal under Section 376 IPC. But in\\nthe very same breath, the High Court has also held [ Anvarsinh  v. State\\nof Gujarat , 2009 SCC OnLine Guj 6145] that the prosecutrix did not\\nwillingly leave her parents’ custody and had not consented to be taken\\nfor marriage. These two findings were canvassed as being mutually\\ncontradictory .\\nThe moot question is, did the court come down from its high pedestal to enquire\\nfrom the girl whether she was enticed or she voluntarily abandoned the care of her\\nguardian? The court in its magnanimity reduced the sentence to the period already\\nunder gone, but what about the stigma of criminality which got attached to the boy in\\na consensual love af fair?

The court iterated in Satbir Singh  v. State of Har yana29\\nthat the phrase “soon before” as appearing in section 304B IPC is not “immediately\\nbefore” but it is enough that the prosecution establishes the existence of “proximate\\nand close link” between the dowry death and cruelty!30 The court also raised a concern\\nregarding recording of statements under section 313 Cr PC in a casual manner by the\\ntrial courts thereby denying the very purpose of this important provision which enables\\nthe accused to of fer an explanation for the incriminatory materials appearing against\\nhim. The same view was reiterated in another dowry death case in Gurmeet Singh  v.\\nState of Punjab .31\\nIn a case where the woman went missing from the matrimonial home and there\\nwere dowry allegations also and the body was recovered from the banks of the river ,\\na presumption was raised against the husband under section 1 13B of the Evidence\\nAct.

The accused preferred an\\nappeal and the Nagpur Bench of the High Court of Bombay disposed of f the appeal\\nby acquitting him of section 8 of the POCSO, Act and convicting him for the of fence\\nunder sections 342 and 354 IPC.

So far as Section 7 of the POCSO  Act is concerned, the first part\\nthereof exhausts a class of act of sexual assault using specific words,\\nand the other part uses the general act beyond the class denoted by the\\nspecific words. In other words, whoever , with sexual intent touches\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch\\nthe vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person,\\nwould be committing an of fence of “sexual assault”. Similarly , whoever\\ndoes any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact\\nwithout penetration, would also be committing the of fence of “sexual\\nassault” under Section 7 of the POCSO  Act. In view of the discussion\\nmade earlier , the prosecution was not required to prove a “skin-to-\\nskin” contact for the purpose of proving the char ge of sexual assault\\nunder Section 7 of the Act.\\nRavindra Bhat J., gave a concurring judgment deftly engaging with the embedded\\npatriarchal notions in IPC of fences like outraging the modesty of a woman. The\\nmandatory minimum was sought to be justified in the judgment given the severity of\\nthe crime and the status of a vulnerable child victim. The court held the accused liable\\nfor sexual assault under section 7 of the POCSO Act punishable under section 8 of\\nthe same and other provisions of the IPC and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment\\nfor three years. However , the judges having taken the dif ficult path of questioning the\\npatriarchy could have also dealt with the problematic aspects of the legislation wherein\\nthe consensual cases also fall in the crime category as the definition of child varies\\nfrom 0-18! And the rigour of the POCSO Act does away with the presumption of\\ninnocence giving way to statutory presumption under section 29 of the POCSO Act.\\nThe Act mandates that the accused has to dischar ge this presumption beyond reasonable\\ndoubt. And this has to be accomplished factoring in a very important provision\\ncontained in section 33(6) of the Act which prohibits aggressive questioning or\\ncharacter assassination of a child. This is indeed necessary so that the victim child is\\nguarded against further victimization.  But when looked from the perspective of a\\nframed accused this also becomes a serious issue as he has to put up a spirited defence.\\nAnd, to top it all, the sentencing discretion has been done away with by incorporating\\nmandatory minimum in the Act. The district judiciary and the special courts will not\\nhave the luxury to decide the case in the lines of K. Prakash  v. State of Karnataka35\\nwherein the accused were convicted of of fences under sections 366 and 344 IPC and\\nsection 6 of the POCSO Act and sentenced to under go imprisonment for a period of\\n10 years.

They\\nspecifically pleaded that there is no one to take care of their minor son\\nand old age parents.\\nIntersectionality\\nThe judgment in Patan Jamal V ali v. State of A.P37 is akin to reading a research\\npaper on intersectionality of violence, gender , caste and disability . The judgment by\\nChandrached J is divided into topics and sub topics (a pattern that the judge has been\\nfollowing) to make it more reader friendly . The judgment unpacks gender , caste and\\ndisability and intersectionality very eloquently in a case of rape of a visually challenged\\ngirl belonging to the SC community . The court made a very apt observation:38\\n Intersectionality merely ur ges us to have “an open-textured legal\\napproach that would examine underlying structures of inequality”. This\\nrequires us to analyse law in its social and economic context allowing\\nus to formulate questions of equality as that of “power and\\npowerlessness” instead of dif ference and sameness. The latter being a\\nconceptual limitation of single axis analysis, it may allow certain\\nintersectional claims to fall through the cracks since such claims are\\nnot unidirectional in nature.\\nFurther , engaging with disability the court remarked:39\\nThis kind of a judicial attitude stems from and perpetuates the\\nunderlying bias and stereotypes against persons with disabilities. We\\nare of the view that the testimony of a prosecutrix with a disability , or\\nof a disabled witness for that matter , cannot be considered weak or\\ninferior , only because such an individual interacts with the world in a\\ndifferent manner , vis-a-vis their able-bodied counterparts. As long as\\nthe testimony of such a witness otherwise meets the criteria for inspiring\\njudicial confidence, it is entitled to full legal weight. It goes without\\nsaying that the court appreciating such testimony needs to be attentive\\nto the fact that the witness’ disability can have the consequence of the\\ntestimony being rendered in a dif ferent form, relative to that of an\\nable-bodied witness. In the case at hand, for instance, PW2’ s blindness\\nmeant that she had no visual contact with the world.

The court in Indrapal Singh  v. State of U.P .41\\nreiterated that “in absence of a common intention even if several persons simultaneously\\nattack the man each one of them would be individually liable for whatever injury he\\ncaused and none would be vicariously convicted for the act of any or the other”.42 The\\nprosecution does not have to prove that there was an elaborate plan between the\\naccused to kill the deceased or a plan was in existence for a long time. A common\\nintention to commit the crime is proved if the accused by their words or action indicate\\ntheir assent to join in the commission of crime.43\\nRavinder Bhat J in Netaji Achyut Shinde (Patil)  v. State44  explained the concept\\nof constructive liability very succinctly by saying that when the physical presence of\\nthe two accused was established and evidence was led by way of independent witnesses\\nthat they facilitated the crime that clearly shows that there was a “consensus of the\\nmind of persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular act”.45\\nCommon object\\nIn India caste dynamics run unabated in spite of progress in other fronts. And\\nespecially where marriages are concerned the communities remain totally embedded\\nin issues of caste. In a case46 a boy and a girl belonging to dif ferent caste wanted to\\nmarry .  A panchayat was convened and the girl from the Jat community made her\\nintention clear of marrying her lover who belonged to the Jatav  community . This\\ninfuriated the Jat community and they ordered that the boy and another boy who\\naccompanied the couple be hung upside down and their private parts be burned. This\\nwas not the end of the macabre show . These two boys along with the girl were ordered\\nto be hanged to death and they were taken to a ‘Banyan Tree’, and the parents of the\\nthree youngsters were forced to pull the rope to strangulate them! 35 people were\\nconvicted by the trial court and in appeal the high court acquitted two persons.

If an unlawful assembly is formed with\\nthe common object of committing an of fence, and if that of fence is\\ncommitted in prosecution of the object by any member of the unlawful\\nassembly , all the members of the assembly will be vicariously liable\\nfor that of fence even if one or more, but not all committed the of fence.\\nAgain, if an of fence is committed by a member of an unlawful assembly\\nand that of fence is one which the members of the unlawful assembly\\nknew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object,\\nevery member who had that knowledge will be guilty of the of fence so\\ncommitted. It is not necessary for the prosecution to prove each of the\\nmembers’ involvement especially regarding which or what act ( Masalti\\nsupra). While overt act and active participation may indicate common\\nintention of the person perpetrating the crime, the mere presence in the\\nunlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminal liability under\\nSection 149 .\\nV INCHOA TE OFFENCES\\nAttempt\\nThe line between preparation and attempt is very thin. However , a careful analysis\\ndoes lay the distinction bare. In a case a minor girl was lured into a room and the\\naccused rubbed his genitals against the child and the child started crying. It was a\\nclear case of attempt to rape and the apex court rightly called the high court order\\ncalling the act as preparation to rape  as ‘perverse and untenable’ and convicted the\\naccused under section 376 read with section  51 1 IPC in State of M.P  v. Mahendra .48\\nAbetment\\nOne of the duties of the school and the teachers also is to discipline children\\nand inculcate good habits in them and this may require some kind of reprimand. In\\nthis case a child was reprimanded by a teacher for repeatedly bunking classes and his\\nparents were called. The child committed suicide that night and was found hanging at\\n4 a.m. The physical training instructor was char ged and convicted by the high court\\nfor abetment of suicide.

In a case where the woman committed suicide within two years of\\nmarriage and the of fence of cruelty stood proved the court presumed that it was a case\\nof abetment. The presumption can be rebutted and since no material was brought on\\nrecord to disprove this presumption the high court conviction under sections 498A\\nand 306 IPC was upheld in Gurmansinh  v. State of Gujarat.51\\nMere harassment without any positive action on the part of the accused proximate\\nto the time of the occurrence of the suicide would not amount to an of fence under\\nsection 306 IPC.52\\nThe court reiterated in Bhagwanrao Mahadeo Patil  v. Appa Ramchandra\\nSavkar53 that section 306 IPC is broader in its application and one aspect of it is\\nsection 304B. If a conviction for causing a suicide is based on section 304B IPC,\\nwhich is a dowry death provision, it will necessarily attract section 306 IPC.

Similarly , in Sy Azhar Sy Kalander  v State of\\nMaharashtra57 the court taking into consideration, inter alia, the compromise entered\\ninto between the two parties while upholding the conviction under section 307 IPC\\nreduced the quantum of punishment to five years.

The fact that 28 years had elapsed and the families\\nwere now on cordial terms did not move the court to give any benefit of the alleged\\ncompromise! The victim was leading his life with a prosthetic arm and leg as a result\\nof the assault which made him permanently disabled.\\nThere has been a trend that in some of the cases the courts factor in the possibility\\nof future crimes while deciding the quantum of sentence. In a case of rape the court in\\nManoj Mishra  v. State of U.P59 gave seven years imprisonment (as one it was a pre\\n2018 case so minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years was not attracted) The discretion\\nwas to give the sentence ranging from seven years to life imprisonment. The court\\nobserved “taking into consideration all facts including that no material is available on\\nrecord to indicate that the appellant has any criminal antecedents and that he is also a\\nfather of five children ….., it appears that there is no reason to apprehend that the\\nappellant would indulge in similar acts in future”? 60.\\nIf consensual sex was the consideration, the court did not mention that.   Since\\nthe girl was minor , it was a case of statutory rape. Therefore, the reasoning of the\\ncourt begs a question that why then in certain cases stricter punishments are awarded\\nkeeping the deterrence theory in mind – that it will deter others? It would be very\\nhumane if the judges were to examine this aspect in each case whether the accused\\nhas a proclivity for further crimes.\\nIn a case where the right of private defense was exceeded the court took note of\\nthe fact that the complainants’ family members were the aggressors and they had tried\\nto disturb the peaceful possession of the accused from the land. The court upheld the\\nconviction under section 304 part II, reduced the quantum of sentence to two years\\nrigorous imprisonment and Rs. 5000 /-fine.61\\nReview petition\\nA review petition was filed in Mofil Khan  v. State of Jharkhand 62 wherein it\\ngot listed to be heard in the  open court since death penalty was awarded to the\\npetitioners by the trial court which was upheld by the high court. The court made it\\nclear that the only jurisdiction in a review petition is to see if there has been a patent\\nmistake or glaring omission due to judicial fallibility . The court did not find any such\\nreason to interfere in the instant case. However , the court took note of the fact that\\nthere is a possibility of reformation and rehabilitation.

State of Maharashtra.4 While answering the question in the af firmative,\\nthe Court observed that as to what type and in which cases the preliminary enquiry is\\nto be conducted will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.\\nIII INVESTIGA TION\\nIn Laxmibai Chandaragi B. v. State of Karnataka,5 the Supreme Court criticised\\nthe investigating of ficer for his failure to close a man missing case instituted on\\ninformation given by parent of a girl after the girl who went missing informed him\\nthat she had married another man. The court took exception to the conduct of the\\ninvestigating of ficer in insisting the girl to report at the police station for recording\\nher statement. According to the court, consent of the family or the community or the\\nclan is not necessary once two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that\\ntheir consent has to be piously given primacy . The court directed the police authorities\\nto counsel the investigating of ficers, devise training programme to educate investigating\\nofficers and also lay down guidelines on how to deal with such socially sensitive\\ncases.\\nIn Supr eme Bhiwandi W ada Manor Infrastr uctur e (P) Ltd. v. State of\\nMaharashtra,6 the Supreme Court set aside an order of the high court since it was\\nfound to be contrary to line of precedents7 dealing with the distinction in the power of\\nthe magistrate under section 156 (3) Cr PC and section 202 Cr PC. According to the\\nCourt the power of the Magistrate under section 156 (3) CrPC. to order investigation\\nby the police is not touched or af fected by section 202 Cr PC. The investigation\\nwhich the magistrate can direct under section 202(1) either by a police of ficer or by\\nany other person is for a limited purpose of enabling the magistrate to decide whether\\nor not there is suf ficient ground to proceed further . The power under Section 156(3)\\ncan be exercised by the magistrate even before he takes cognizance provided the\\ncomplaint discloses the commission of cognizable of fence.\\nIn Sidhar th v. State of U. P .8 the Supreme Court had occasion to criticise the\\napproach of trial courts in insisting on the arrest of the accused as a prerequisite\\nformality to take a char gesheet on record.9 According to the Supreme Court, section\\n170 Cr PC does not impose an obligation on the of ficer-in-char ge to arrest each and\\nevery accused at the time of filing of the char ge-sheet. If the investigating of ficer\\ndoes not believe that the accused will abscond or disobey summons he/she is not\\nrequired to be produced in custody . The word “custody” appearing in section 170 Cr\\nPC., according to the Court, does not contemplate either police or judicial custody\\nbut it merely connotes the presentation of the accused by the investigating of ficer\\n4 (2021) 5 SCC 469.\\n5 (2021) 3 SCC 360.\\n6 (2021) 8 SCC 753\\n7 Supr eme Bhiwandi W ada Manor Infrastr uctur e (P) Ltd. v.

The court also pointed out the distinction\\nbetween the existence of power to arrest and justification for exercise of that power .\\nIt observed:10\\n……….  personal liberty is an important aspect of our constitutional\\nmandate. The occasion to arrest an accused during investigation arises\\nwhen custodial investigation becomes necessary or it is a heinous crime\\nor where there is a possibility of influencing the witnesses or accused\\nmay abscond. Merely because an arrest can be made because it is lawful\\ndoes not mandate that arrest must be made. A distinction must be made\\nbetween the existence of the power to arrest and the justification for\\nexercise of it. If arrest is made routine, it can cause incalculable harm\\nto the reputation and self-esteem of a person. If the investigating of ficer\\nhas no reason to believe that the accused will abscond or disobey\\nsummons and has, in fact, throughout cooperated with the investigation\\nwe fail to appreciate why there should be a compulsion on the of ficer\\nto arrest the accused.\\nIn Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay Sharma,11the Supreme Court reiterated the procedure\\nto be followed when there is a complaint and police investigation in respect of the\\nsame of fence. According to the court there is no bar to lodge an FIR when a complaint\\nhas been filed earlier on the same set of facts with the same set of allegations and\\naverments.\\nThe Supreme Court and high courts are ‘sentinels of justice’ that ensure that\\nrule of law and constitutional guarantees of a fair and impartial investigation are\\nupheld. While investigating of fences justice must not only be done but also be seen\\nand perceived to be done. In the past the Supreme Court has made creative interventions\\nto ensure fairness in investigations by taking steps for monitoring investigations by\\npolice on a daily basis. Such an intervention was made by the Supreme Court during\\nthe period covered by this survey . The Supreme Court was seized of the In re Violence\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri (Uttar Pradesh) Leading to Loss of Life12 matter when two lawyers\\nwrote to the court seeking an independent inquiry into an incident in which several\\npeople who were protesting against the Agricultural Acts of 2020 were rammed from\\nbehind and run over by a vehicle resulting in eight deaths and injury to several others.\\nEver since then, the case was investigated by a Special Investigation Team which\\nessentially comprised of middle level/subordinate level of ficers of U.P . police posted\\nin Lakhimpur Kheri district. When the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court on\\nvarious occasions some of the parties questioned the fairness of the investigation\\nconducted by the SIT .

State of M.P .14, the Supreme Court modified an order passed\\nby the Indore Bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court whereby the high court had\\ngranted anticipatory bail to an accused subject to the condition of deposit of Rs 41\\nlakhs in court and upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 with\\none solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting of ficer. While\\nissuing the said order the high court had further directed that the order would be\\ngoverned by conditions 1 to 3 of sub-section (2) of section 438 of the Cr PC. The trial\\ncourt was also directed to deposit the amount so deposited by the appellant with any\\nnationalised bank.The Supreme Court expressed the view that by imposing the\\ncondition of deposit of Rs 41 lakhs, the high court has, in an application for pre-arrest\\nbail under section 438 of the Cr PC, virtually issued directions in the nature of recovery\\nin a civil suit. The court clarified:15\\nIt is well settled by a plethora of decisions of this Court that criminal\\nproceedings are not for realisation of disputed dues. It is open to a\\ncourt to grant or refuse the prayer for anticipatory bail, depending on\\nthe facts and circumstances of the particular case. The factors to be\\ntaken into consideration, while considering an application for bail are\\nthe nature of accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case\\nof conviction and the nature of the materials relied upon by the\\nprosecution; reasonable apprehension of tampering with the witnesses\\nor apprehension of threat to the complainant or the witnesses; reasonable\\npossibility of securing the presence of the accused at the time of trial\\nor the likelihood of his abscondence; character , behaviour and standing\\nof the accused; and the circumstances which are peculiar or the accused\\nand lar ger interest of the public or the S tate and similar other\\nconsiderations. A criminal court, exercising jurisdiction to grant bail/\\nanticipatory bail, is not expected to act as a recovery agent to realise\\nthe dues of the complainant, and that too, without any trial.\\nWith a view to avoid unnecessary bail matters reaching the court, the Supreme\\nCourt in Satender Kumar Antil v.

According to the court the bail application to be ultimately\\nconsidered, would be guided by the relevant statutory provisions.\\nAfter reiterating the legal position as laid down in Sushila Aggar wal v. State\\n(NCT of Delhi),19 and guided by the consideration of nature and gravity of the alleged\\noffence, the Supreme Court in Supreme Bhiwandi W ada Manor Infrastr uctur e (P)\\nLtd. v. State of Maharashtra ,20 set aside an order granting anticipatory bail to an\\naccused who was alleged to have fraudulently misappropriated amounts intended to\\nbe paid by a company to the farmers af fected by the work of road widening. The court\\nexpressed the view that the order granting anticipatory bail suf fered from serious\\ninfirmities resulting in miscarriage of justice.\\nNon-compliance with the procedure contained in section 41 CrPC before\\narresting an accused, as adumbrated in the judgment in Arnesh Kumar  v. State of\\nBihar ,21 was taken as a factor for releasing him on interim bail.22\\nIn Union of India v . K.A. Najeeb,23 the Supreme Court emphasised on the need\\nfor harmonising the restrictions in the matter of grant of bail imposed by a statute as\\nwell as the powers exercisable under constitutional jurisdiction. According to the\\nCourt, statutory restrictions like Section 43-D(5) of the UAP A per se does not oust\\nthe power of the constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of violation of Part III\\nof the Constitution. At commencement of proceedings, the courts are expected to\\nappreciate the legislative policy against grant of bail but the rigours of such provisions\\nwill melt down where there is no likelihood of trial being completed within a reasonable\\ntime and the period of incarceration already under gone has exceeded a substantial\\npart of the prescribed sentence.\\nReasons have virtually become as indispensable a component of a decision-\\nmaking process as observing principles of natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial\\nand even by administrative bodies.Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised\\nby the decision-maker on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous\\nconsiderations.Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial accountability\\nand transparency . Time and again the Supreme Court has emphasised the need for\\nassigning reasons while issuing an order granting bail to an accused. In Brijmani\\nDevi v.

State of Gujarat,25 wherein the Supreme Court while considering\\na special leave petition filed against an order granting ad interim protection from\\narrest remitted the matter back to the High Court of Gujarat with a direction to consider\\nthe application for anticipatory bail afresh and dispose the same by recording reasons\\nfor the order .\\nThe necessity of recording reasons for grant of bail was also emphasised in\\nseveral other judgments delivered during the period covered by this survey .26\\nIn State of Maharashtra v. Pankaj Jagshi Gangar ,27the Supreme Court deprecated\\nthe tendency of certain accused to go for forum-shopping in the matter of bail. In this\\ncase a person accused of of fences under MCOCA  filed an appeal before a single\\njudge of high court against the order of a special judge. While the bail application\\nwas pending before the single judge, the accused sensing that the judge was not inclined\\nto grant bail, withdrew the appeal and thereafter preferred a writ petition before a\\ndivision bench of the high court under the guise of challenging the vires of MCOCA.\\nWithout being aware of what transpired earlier , the division bench released the accused\\non bail and that too by way of interim relief. The Supreme Court referred to this as an\\ninstance of forum shopping and described it as a conduct which cannot be approved.\\nThe order passed by the division bench of the high court was therefore quashed and\\nset aside by the Supreme Court.\\nIn Enfor cement Dir ectorate, Government of India  v.

The Supreme Court held that while applying the principle of\\nparity a court cannot exercise its power in a capricious manner and that the court has\\nto consider the totality of circumstances before granting bail. In Ramesh Bhavan\\nRathod35 the court also expressed its disapproval at the observation of the High Court\\nthat the grant of bail to one accused shall not be considered as a precedent for any\\nother person who is accused in the FIR on grounds of parity . According to the Supreme\\nCourt such an observation did not constitute judicially appropriate reasoning.

For example, the applicant may plead protection\\nfor some time as he/she is the primary caregiver or breadwinner of his/\\nher family members, and needs to make arrangements for them. In\\nsuch extraordinary circumstances, when a strict case for grant of\\nanticipatory bail is not made out, and rather the investigating authority\\nhas made out a case for custodial investigation, it cannot be stated that\\nthe High Court has no power to ensure justice.\\nWhile making the above observation, the Supreme Court located the source of\\nthe said power in section 482 Cr PC.

A\\nsignificant factor in this backlog is the vast mass of frivolous litigation instituted year\\nafter year by litigants with an intent to use the courts of justice for their own\\nmischievous ends. Curtailing such vexatious litigation is, thus, a crucial step towards\\na more ef fective justice system—a step that cannot be taken without the active\\ninvolvement of the lower judiciary , especially in criminal proceedings. In Krishna\\nLal Chawla v. State of U.P .43 (2021) 5 SCC 435the Supreme Court highlighted the\\nrole of trial judges in identifying and disposing of frivolous litigation at an early\\nstage. In paragraph 17 of Krishna Lal Chawla44 the court made the following\\nobservation:\\nImmediately after the criminal justice system is set in motion, its course\\nis almost entirely dependent on the judicial application of mind by the\\nMagistrate. When a police complaint is filed on the commission of a\\ncognizable of fence under Section 154 CrPC, the Magistrate decides if\\nthe char ge against the accused person is made out before the trial begins.\\nSeparate procedure is prescribed if the complaint under Section 200\\nCrPC is filed.

In India, typically , the Judge is not actively involved in “fact-\\nfinding” owing to the adversarial nature of our justice system. However ,\\nSection 165 of the Evidence Act, 1872 by providing the Judge with the\\npower to order production of material and put forth questions of any\\nform at any time, marks the influence of inquisitorial processes in our\\nlegal system.

According to the court,\\nsanction under section 197 Cr PC is necessary if the of fence alleged against the public\\nservant is committed by him “while acting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his\\nofficial duty” and in order to find out whether the alleged of fence is committed “while\\nacting or purporting to act in the dischar ge of his of ficial duty”, the yardstick to be\\nfollowed is to form a prima facie  view whether the act of omission for which the\\naccused was char ged had a reasonable connection with the dischar ge of his duties.\\nVII WITNESS PROTECTION\\nFor instance, In Re V iolence in Lakhimpur Kheri (UP) Leading to Loss of Life48\\nthe Supreme Court directed the state government to provide protection to all witnesses\\nconnected with the case as per the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.\\nVIII FRAMING OF CHARGE\\nThe factors to be considered at the time of framing of char ge were reiterated\\nand summarised in State of Rajasthan  v. Ashok Kumar Kashyap.49\\nIX TRANSFER OF CRIMINAL  CASES\\nTime and again the courts have observed that no hard and fast rule can be\\nprescribed for deciding a transfer petition which will always have to be decided on\\nthe facts of each case. Convenience for the purposes of transfer means the convenience\\nof the prosecution, other accused, the witnesses and the lar ger interest of the\\nsociety .Convenience of a party may be one of the relevant considerations but cannot\\noverride all other considerations such as the availability of witnesses exclusively at\\nthe original place, making it virtually impossible to continue with the trial at the place\\nof transfer , and progress of which would naturally be impeded for that reason at the\\n46 Subramanian Swamy v.

State (NCT  of Delhi),50 the Supreme\\nCourt refused to transfer a criminal case from Delhi to Allahabad (Prayagraj) on the\\nground that most of the prosecution witnesses were located at Delhi. According to the\\ncourt, if the transfer petition is allowed, the witnesses would be required to travel\\nfrom Delhi to Allahabad, which in turn would cause hindrance in performing their\\nofficial duties.\\nX EXERCISE OF INHERENT POWERS\\nThe inherent jurisdiction under section 482 Cr PC is designed to achieve the\\nsalutary purpose that criminal proceedings ought not to be permitted to degenerate\\ninto weapon of harassment. While quashing an FIR in Kapil Agar wal v. Sanjay\\nSharma,51the Supreme Court reiterated the settled position that criminal proceedings\\ncan be quashed when the court is satisfied that such proceedings amount to an abuse\\nof process of law or that it amounts to bringing pressure upon the accused. A litigant\\npursuing frivolous and vexatious proceedings cannot claim unlimited right upon court\\ntime and public money to achieve his ends. It has therefore been held that the inherent\\npower can be exercised by the court to deny any relief to a litigant who attempts to\\npollute the stream of justice by coming to it with his unclean hands.52\\nThe question whether an interim order of no coercive steps during proceedings\\nunder section 482 Cr PC and/or under article 226 of the Constitution of India could\\nbe passed by the High Court was addressed by the Supreme Court in two judgments\\npronounced during the period covered by the survey . In Neeharika Infrastr uctur e\\nPrivate Ltd.  v. State of Maharashtra53the Supreme Court frowned upon the tendency\\nof the courts to pass blanket, cryptic, laconic, non-speaking orders reading “ no coer cive\\nsteps shall be adopted ”.However , it allowed space for the high court to pass such\\norders “ in exceptional cases with caution and cir cumspection, giving brief r easons ”.\\nSubsequently in Siddhar thMukesh Bhandari v. State of Gujarat,54 the court while\\nreiterating the position taken in Neeharika Infrastr uctur e55 noted:56\\nAn interim order of stay of investigation during the pendency of the\\nquashing petition can be passed with circumspection. Such an interim\\norder should not require to be passed routinely , casually and/or\\nmechanically . Normally , when the investigation is in progress and the\\nfacts are hazy and the entire evidence/material is not before the High\\nCourt, the High Court should restrain itself from passing the interim\\norder of not to arrest or “no coercive steps to be adopted” and the\\naccused should be relegated to apply for anticipatory bail under Section\\n438CrPC before the competent court.

Mahesh Coop. Urban bank Shar eholders W elfare Assn. v.

State of Punjab,60 the Supreme Court summarised the law\\nrelating to the requisite tests to be applied by the trial court while applying the principles\\nenunciated in section 218 to 223 Cr PC. i.e., while taking an appropriate decision on\\nwhether there should be a joint or separate trial.  The two-pronged test that should be\\napplied by the trial court is (a) whether conducting a joint/separate trial will prejudice\\nthe defence of the accused and/or (b) whether conducting a joint/separate trail would\\ncause judicial delay .\\nThe Supreme Court has consistently taken the position that a retrial or a de\\nnovo trial should be th e last resort and that too when such a course becomes desperately\\n57 (2021) 9 SCC 152.\\n58 Neeharika Infrastr uctur e Private Ltd.  v.

A retrial should be limited to the extreme exigency to avert a “failure\\nof justice”. In Nasib Singh ,61 the court also had the occasion to summarise the principles\\nthat emer ge from the various judicial pronouncements of the Supreme Court in the\\nmatter of ordering retrials. The principles are enumerated below:62\\ni.The appellate court may direct a retrial only in “exceptional” circumstances\\nto avert a miscarriage of justice.\\nii.Mere lapses in the investigation are not suf ficient to warrant a direction\\nfor retrial. Only if the lapses are so grave so as to prejudice the rights of\\nthe parties, can a retrial be directed.\\niii.A determination of whether a “shoddy” investigation/trial has prejudiced\\nthe party , must be based on the facts of each case pursuant to a thorough\\nreading of the evidence.\\niv.It is not suf ficient if the accused/prosecution makes a facial ar gument that\\nthere has been a miscarriage of justice warranting a retrial. It is incumbent\\non the appellate court directing a retrial to provide a reasoned order on the\\nnature of the miscarriage of justice caused with reference to the evidence\\nand investigatory process.\\nThe aim of every court is to discover the truth. Section 31 1 Cr PC is one of the\\nprovisions which strengthen the arms of a court in its ef fort to unearth the truth by\\nprocedure sanctioned by law . In V. N. Patil  v. K. Niranjan Kumar63 the Supreme Court\\nwhile summarising the principles relating to object and scope of section 31 1 Cr PC\\nheld that the discretionary power vested in the courts has to be exercised judiciously\\nfor strong and valid reasons and with caution and circumspection to meet the ends of\\njustice.\\nXI POWER TO PROCEED AGAINST  OTHER PERSONS\\nThe position regarding the exercise of power under section 319 Cr PC i.e.,\\npower to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of of fence was clarified\\nby a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court as early as in 2014.64 In Ramesh Chandra\\nSrivastava v. State of U.P .65 a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court reiterated the\\nposition as laid down in Hardeep Singh66 and held that the power under section 319\\nCr PC should be exercised only when strong and cogent evidence occurs against a\\nperson from the evidence. In the instant case the Sessions Judge had exercised the\\npower under section 319 Cr PC in a casual and cavalier manner . The order of the\\nsessions judge was unsuccessfully challenged before the High Court. While allowing\\nan appeal by special leave the Supreme Court set aside the order passed by the sessions\\njudge and directed him to apply his mind in the light of the principles laid down by\\n61 Nasib Singh v.

Further a person not named in the FIR or a person though named in the\\nFIR but has not been char ge-sheeted or a person who has been dischar ged can be\\nsummoned under section 319 Cr PC, provided from the evidenceit appears that such\\nperson can be tried along with the accused already facing trial.\\nIn Ajay Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand,69 the Supreme Court further reminded\\nthat the power under section 319 Cr PC is a discretionary and extraordinary power\\nwhich is to be exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the circumstances of\\nthe case so warrant.\\nXII APPEALS\\nWhile considering an appeal against conviction, the Supreme Court, in Samaul\\nS. K.  v. State of Jharkhand,70used the voluntary initiative of the accused to pay an\\namount of Rs. 3 lakhs for the benefit of the victim and her children as a ground to\\nreduce the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment for an of fence under section\\n498A to seven months imprisonment which was the period of incarceration already\\nunder gone by him on the date of the order .\\nThe scope of the power of a court considering an appeal against acquittal was\\nclarified further in Jayamma v. State of Karnataka.71 According to the Supreme Court,\\nunless the high court finds that there is complete misreading of the material evidence\\nwhich has led to miscarriage of justice, the view taken by the trial court which can\\nalso possibly be a correct view , need not be interfered with. This self-restraint doctrine,\\nof course, does not denude the high court of its powers to reappreciate the evidence,\\nincluding in an appeal against acquittal and arrive at a dif ferentfinding of fact.\\nWhile discussing the scope of the powers of an appellate court dealing with an\\nappeal against acquittal, the Supreme Court in Achhar Singh v. State of H.P .72 held\\nthat though it is a well-crystallised principle that if two views are possible, the High\\nCourt ought not to interfere with the trial court’ s judgment, such a precautionary\\nprinciple cannot be overstretched to portray that the “ contours of appeal ” against\\nacquittal under Section 378 Cr PC are limited to seeing whether or not the trial court’ s\\nview was impos sible.\\n67 Hardeep Singh  v.

State of Punjab,73 the Supreme Court had identified the\\nanti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime as one of the factors that may be\\ntaken into account by the court for imposition of death sentence. In Hari  v. State of\\nUttar Pradesh74decided during the period covered by the survey the Court held that\\nthe ghastly murders of three youngsters which are honour killings squarely falls under\\nthe head of anti-social and abhorrent nature of the crime as mentioned in Machi Singh .75\\nIn Bhagchandra  v. State of Madhya Pradesh76Supreme Court converted the\\ndeath sentence awarded to a convict who murdered two of his siblings and one nephew\\nto life imprisonment for a period of two years. The court noted:77\\nIn view of the settled legal position, it is our bounden duty to take into\\nconsideration the probability of the accused being reformed and\\nrehabilitated. It is also our duty to take into consideration not only the\\ncrime but also the criminal, his state of mind and his socio-economic\\nconditions. The deceased as well as the appellant are rustic villagers.\\nIn a property dispute, the appellant has got done away with two of his\\nsiblings and a nephew . The S tate has not placed on record any evidence\\nto show that there is no possibility with respect to reformation or\\nrehabilitation of the convict. …………………………………………\\nThe appellant comes from a rural and economically poor background.\\nThere are no criminal antecedents. The appellant cannot be said to be\\na hardened criminal. This is the first of fence committed by the appellant,\\nno doubt, a heinous one.

It cannot therefore be said that there is no possibility of\\nthe appellant being reformed and rehabilitated foreclosing the\\nalternative option of a lesser sentence and making imposition of death\\nsentence imperative.\\nIn another case78 the court commuted the death sentence awarded to a convict\\nfor the of fence punishable under section 302 IPC to one of life imprisonment on the\\nfollowing grounds:79\\nThe appellant is a young person, who was 23 years old at the time of\\ncommission of the of fence.

It therefore cannot be said\\nthat there is no possibility of the appellant being reformed and\\nrehabilitated foreclosing the alternative option of a lesser sentence and\\nmaking imposition of death sentence imperative.\\nOn earlier occasions, through decisions such as Muthuramalingam,80 O. M.\\nCherian81 and Nagaraja Rao82the Supreme Court has clarified that while awarding\\nmultiple sentences a court of first instance is under a legal obligation to specify in\\nclear terms as to whether they would run concurrently or consecutively and that\\nsentences awarded by a court for several of fences committed by a convict shall run\\nconsecutively unless otherwise directed by the court. In Sunil Kumar v . State of U.P .83the\\nSupreme Court came across a situation where not only the trial court but also the\\nHigh Court omitted to specify whether the sentences awarded to the convicts shall\\nrun concurrently or consecutively . Though it observed that the omissions will not, by\\nthemselves, provide a room for concurrent running of sentences, the Court keeping in\\nview the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case invoked its power under Article\\n142 so as to modify the punishment awarded to the convicts in the manner that the\\nmaximum period of imprisonment to be served by them in relation to of fences in\\nquestion shall be 14 years and not beyond.\\nXIV REMISSION OF SENTENCES\\nIn State of Har yana v. Raj Kumar ,84 the Supreme Court had an opportunity to\\naddress the nature and scope of power of the Governor under article 161 of Constitution\\nof India and the manner in which the said power was to be exercised. Holding that the\\nrestrictions under section 433-A cannot apply to the constitutional power under article\\n161 of the Constitution of India, the court observed:85\\n[t]he power of the appropriate Government to release a prisoner after\\nserving 14 years of actual imprisonment is vested with the S tate\\nGovernment.

Thus, if a prisoner has under gone more than 14 years of actual\\nimprisonment, the S tate Government, as an appropriate Government,\\nis competent to pass an order of premature release, but if the prisoner\\nhas not under gone 14 years or more of actual imprisonment, the\\nGovernor has a power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites and\\nremissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence\\nof any person dehors the restrictions imposed under Section 433-A of\\nthe Constitution. Such power is in exercise of the power of the\\nsovereign, though the Governor is bound to act on the aid and advice\\nof the S tate Government.\\nXV SAFEGAURDING RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF CRIME\\nIn X v. State of Jharkhand,86 the Supreme Court after referring to its own\\njudgment in NipunSaxena  v. Union of India,87 reminded the media of its obligation to\\nnot print or publish the name of the rape victims or even in a remote manner disclose\\nany facts which can lead to the suchvictims being identified.\\nXVI COMPOUNDING OF OFFENCES\\nThe mere fact that an of fence is compoundable with consent of the court need\\nnot persuade the court to automatically or mechanically exercise the power of\\ncompounding. Nature of the of fence and its ef fect on society are relevant\\nconsiderations, which the court must consider carefully while determining whether\\nleave to compound of fence is to be granted or not. Thus, in Pravat Chandra Mohanty\\nv. State of Odisha,88 the Supreme Court observed that of fences involving police\\nbrutalities are crimes not only against the victims but also against humanity and hence\\npermission for compounding of such of fences cannot be granted by the court.89\\nXVII SETTLEMENT  BETWEEN P ARTIES\\nIn Murali v. State,90 the Supreme Court while considering an appeal filed by an\\naccused who had been convicted for the of fences punishable under sections 324 and\\n341 IPC reduced his sentence to the period already under gone. Though the of fences\\nwere non-compoundable in nature and in spite of concurrent findings of three preceding\\nforums, the Court considered the case to be a fit one to take a sympathetic view . That\\nthe parties to the dispute have buried their hatchet; that the convicts were young\\ncollege students at the time of commission of the of fence; that there was no previous\\nenmity between the parties; that the convicts had no previous criminal antecedents;\\nthat they were the sole bread earners of their families and had significant social\\n86 (2021) 2 SCC 598.\\n87 (2019) 2 SCC 703.\\n88 (2021) 3 SCC 529.\\n89 In the instant case the police of ficers were prosecuted, inter alia, for the of fence punishable\\nunder section 324 IPC. At the time of commission of the of fence, section 324 was an of fence\\nwhich could be compounded with the permission of the court. However , it may be noted that\\nsection 324 was made non-compoundable by way of an amendment in 2005.\\n90 (2021) 1 SCC 726.', metadata={'source': 'us_census\\\\009-Criminal Procedure.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",
